# The Foundry

> A shared narrative universe for **Ironsworn**, **Starforged**, and **Sundered Isles** players

---

## Welcome, Traveler

You've found **The Foundry** — a collaborative storytelling space where players share their solo and co-op RPG campaigns, explore each other's adventures, and build interconnected worlds together.

This site is a live snapshot of our shared Obsidian vault. Everything you see here — the characters, journals, factions, and worlds — is created by players like you using [Iron Vault](https://ironvault.quest/) and synced through GitHub.

## Read the Adventures

Dive into the stories being told right now. Each campaign folder contains characters, journals, locations, factions, and more — all created by players exploring these worlds.

Browse the folders in the sidebar to discover:
- **Characters** — The heroes and NPCs driving each story
- **Journals** — Session logs and narrative entries
- **Locations** — Planets, settlements, sectors, and maps
- **Factions** — The powers and organizations shaping each universe
- **Progress** — Vows, quests, and ongoing storylines

Every campaign is a living world. New entries appear as players continue their adventures.

## Want to Join?

The Foundry isn't just for reading — it's for playing. You can:

- **Start your own campaign** in your own folder
- **Join an existing campaign** by creating your character in someone else's world
- **Write journal entries** that interweave with other players' stories

Every file has one owner — whoever created it. You can read everything, but you can only edit your own files. The world grows through addition, not modification.

**Ready to play?** See [[2. Getting Started]] for the full setup guide.
