The great warrior mastered himself as the laughter on the comms redoubled when the public's comments on it passed a thousand within the last hour. He had already dispensed monetary compensation, billed to his family holdings via the Courier Guild and thus honour was satisfied for the mess he had made, but there yet remained the taunting judgement of his peers.

He would most certainly dispense harsh punishments for this betrayal, because he definitely wasn't laughing with them, Epathus included. `iv-oracle:Likely|47|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.likely`  `iv-noroll:Develop Your Relationship|move:starforged/connection/develop_your_relationship`  `iv-track-advance:Find where he stands with Epathus|The Starforged/Campaign Tybalt-Yhen Serrato/Progress/Tybalt-Yhen Serrato/Find where he stands with Epathus.md|12|14|extreme|1` 

But there yet remained the matter of their prisoner, whom he and Paxel were dragging back to the *Kaal-Kaaz* for interrogation.

> Was this attack ordered by an important local? `iv-oracle:Likely|6|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.likely`  

Did the local law enforcement (A rabble of Audun-born musclemen and two-credit mercenaries hiding from the consequences of past deeds in Terminus, who primarily exist to protect the interests of their disparate patrons) try to stop them, presumably to stop Tybalt from finding out some inconvenient truth?

Yes.

`iv-move:Compel|Iron|6|3|0|6|7|move:starforged/adventure/compel` But were they paid enough to tell a Serrato Bannersworn in full warplate that he couldn’t do what he wanted?

No.

But once they were within the ship, Paxel (who was the one dragging the body, leaving Tybalt to be the one doing any potential fighting) stops in his tracks, and feels for a pulse.

“What the-” He starts in confusion, because prior examination showed no signs of (lethal) internal damage, before rapidly shifting to crisis response “Tybalt, get the sawbones, prick just stopped breathing!”

Just as Tybalt was about to turn and do so, he sees Paxel jump away from the body he was setting down to try and resuscitate. And before the two men the assassin rights himself in all the wrong ways. Straightening not like a man trying to regain his footing, but a marionette on strings, twisting and turning in ways that human muscles do not enable lest they damage themselves in the exertion, all without even a single breath save for a death rattle. For example, by the time Paxel levels his mag-rifle at the body, it elicits sickening cracks from its own spine from trying to far quicker than its lower half could keep up.

And right then, Tybalt puts a hand on the barrel and forces it down, and the lizard mutant realises that his bloodthirsty superior somehow wasn’t flying off the handle at it.

“Tybalt, what are doing?! Rip this thing apart, it’s-“

“A medium of communication, at present.” Tybalt interrupts, even if his voice is rich with discomfort, before turning to the risen corpse. “What do you seek from Household Serrato, that you would call upon the services of a [First Light](obsidian://open?vault=Ironverse&file=The%20Starforged%2FLocations%2FSettlements%2FFirst%20Light) corpse-witch?”

`iv-oracle:Descriptor|131|Exotic|oracle_rollable:starsmith/core/descriptor` The jerkiness begins to recede, and the corpse more readily assumes the straight-backed posture of a Terminus socialite as it removed its mask, to show that the dead man’s dusky features wore another person’s smile.

“Only to help, Tybalt-Yhen.” Said the stranger with all the glee of a shameless liar “We have a common enemy at the moment, who has taken umbrage with your questions.” As if to clarify, they gestures loosely at the body they had puppeted.

> Is it part of the Risen Union?  `iv-oracle:50/50|43|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty`

"Have you noticed the Risen Union showing up more and more lately? There's nothing special at first glance, just another conglomerate charging whole limbs for their goods, in their case mass-produced goods. Even having whole production lines of *gunpowder munitions* fit only for hardscrabble colonist militias.

This, of course, is a farce. The real heart of the group, whether it was always there or just hollowed out an existing group fit for purpose, are infobrokers. Spies and the like, who seem very good at their job. Why, they've managed the *good fortune* of steering clear of any sort of trouble from the Ascendancy, and so their star is in ascendance here in Port Koshiba and beyond."

“And we're suposed

The corpse makes Tybalt want to bisect it by dramatically feigning shock for its puppeteer. “Oh my Stars! And here I thought the Serrato prized family?”

In the blink of an eye, the persona of an irritating trust-fundee gives way to the cold glare of a blood-drenched spymaster, as he coldly dispels Tybalt’s confusion.

“Where do you think your father’s body is?”

A minute of stunned silence passes before either responds. “Bullshit” Tybalt tries to declare, horrified by how weak he sounded. “He was fighting near the e-drive of the *Hermes* when it self-destructed. The battle-reports confirm it.”

“They confirm his *warplate* was near the e-drive. But can you say he was seen alive and fighting, or was it simply hacked to declare as much?”
