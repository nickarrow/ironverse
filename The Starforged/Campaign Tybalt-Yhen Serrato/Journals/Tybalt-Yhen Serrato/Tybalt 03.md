The great warrior mastered himself as the laughter on the comms redoubled when the public's comments on it passed a thousand within the last hour. He had already dispensed monetary compensation, billed to his family holdings via the Courier Guild and thus honour was satisfied for the mess he had made, but there yet remained the taunting judgement of his peers.

He would most certainly dispense harsh punishments for this betrayal, because he definitely wasn't laughing with them, Epathus included. `iv-oracle:Likely|47|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.likely`  `iv-noroll:Develop Your Relationship|move:starforged/connection/develop_your_relationship`  `iv-track-advance:Find where he stands with Epathus|The Starforged/Campaign Tybalt-Yhen Serrato/Progress/Tybalt-Yhen Serrato/Find where he stands with Epathus.md|12|14|extreme|1` 

But there yet remained the matter of their prisoner, whom he and Paxel were dragging back to the *Kaal-Kaaz* for interrogation.

> Was this attack ordered by an important local? `iv-oracle:Likely|6|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.likely`  

Did the local law enforcement (A rabble of Audun-born musclemen and two-credit mercenaries hiding from the consequences of past deeds in Terminus, who primarily exist to protect the interests of their disparate patrons) try to stop them, presumably to stop Tybalt from finding out some inconvenient truth?

Yes.

`iv-move:Compel|Iron|6|3|0|6|7|move:starforged/adventure/compel` But were they paid enough to tell a Serrato Bannersworn in full warplate that he couldn’t do what he wanted?

No.

But once they were within the ship, Paxel (who was the one dragging the body, leaving Tybalt to be the one doing any potential fighting) stops in his tracks, and feels for a pulse.

“What the-” He starts in confusion, because prior examination showed no signs of (lethal) internal damage, before rapidly shifting to crisis response “Tybalt, get the sawbones, prick just stopped breathing!”

Just as Tybalt was about to turn and do so, he sees Paxel jump away from the body he was setting down to try and resuscitate. And before the two men the assassin rights himself in all the wrong ways. Straightening not like a man trying to regain his footing, but a marionette on strings, twisting and turning in ways that human muscles do not enable lest they damage themselves in the exertion, all without even a single breath save for a death rattle. For example, by the time Paxel levels his mag-rifle at the body, it elicits sickening cracks from its own spine from trying to far quicker than its lower half could keep up.

And right then, Tybalt puts a hand on the barrel and forces it down, and the lizard mutant realises that his bloodthirsty superior somehow wasn’t flying off the handle at it.

“Tybalt, what are doing?! Axe this thing, it’s-“

“A medium of communication.” Tybalt interrupts, even if his voice is rich with discomfort, before turning to the risen corpse. “What do you seek from Household Serrato, that you would call upon the services of a [First Light](obsidian://open?vault=Ironverse&file=The%20Starforged%2FLocations%2FSettlements%2FFirst%20Light) corpse-witch?”
