Sable spat into the sink in the lavatory and another piece of her tooth fell into the basic. Tears were running down her face as she dug at her gums trying to relieve herself of the pieces of bones that had become dislodged from her jaw. She spate again and held her mouth while she whined.

The ache had been getting worse over the day, only to wake her in a cold sweat and the most unimaginable pain she had ever remembered being in. He hadn't just chipped the tooth. She would have to get the thing worked on before infection settled in.

"I hate the fucking dentist..." she commiserated with the sad, disheveled, bloody image of her in the mirror.

It was time to move on.

The ramp clicked into place with a satisfying accordion of extending metal. 

“Glad to see you arrived safe my dear—“ 

Sable stopped in her tracks as she was met with a wall of personal and at the center of it was finely dressed man leaning on a cane. 

“Glad to see I’m safe too—if you’ll excuse me.” She disembarked and moved to retract the ramp.

She felt the cane rest firmly on her shoulder, “I appreciate your diligence, I’m Merrick Arden, you have my package.”

Sable turned back and forced a painful smile. “I have to confirm—you understand.”

“Of course, of course, Ganden—“ The rest went unsaid but entirely understood. A man with a datapad walked forward and showed Sable the face of it. Sable scanned the code and the confirmation popped up—this was Merrick Arden.

His cane clacked on the ground as he walked closer to her.

“I shall have my surgeon look at that.” His bent calloused fingers touched her bruised lip. “That boy did a number on this beautiful face.”

“How did—“

“Of course there was surveillance attached to the package. What kind of curator would I be if I didn’t keep a close eye on what I acquire. 
“Yes, I know about the Serrato man that was on your ship. You were careful and I’m understanding so all of forgiven, but best not to be so careless again.” He squeezed her jaw just enough to shoot pain through her skull, but she did her best not to wince too hard.

“The Courier Guild appreciates your understanding,” Sable shifted and worked to turn over the package.

`iv-ooc:I'm adding +2 to the Sojourn move due to the hit with a match from the journey move. `  `iv-move:Sojourn|Heart|3|1|2|5|3|move:starforged/recover/sojourn|adds=2(Strong Hit with a Match)`   `iv-move:Heal|Iron|4|2|0|8|2|move:starforged/recover/heal`  `iv-meter:Health|1|4`   `iv-move:Hearten|Heart|4|1|0|4|4|move:starforged/recover/hearten` 

"Walk with me," his demand was soft, warm, almost sounding like a suggestion, but it was anything but. Merrick didn't seem like the kind of person to be refused. "You are an impressive pilot Sable."

"Thank you." Sable waited in anticipation for whatever that compliment was going to cost her. She might well be a warm biscuit for how he was buttering her up.

"You were attacked were you not?"

"I was. I evaded the situation." She replied.

"Very well, but even I can see that this frontier can be—demanding." He was choosing his words carefully.

They wound through the crowded streets and Merrick talked with Sable about her ship. How he had noticed the damage done to it and how apologetic he was for how hard fought the journey was. It wasn't. He knew that, and so did Sable. This was an act. He ingratiated himself to her, offering all sorts of services in exchange for how well she done on the job. He didn't need to do that, he paid her the compensation that was required, he didn't need to pay her anything else, but the kindness she received today would come at a great cost.

But she fell for it. At the time she blamed it on the pain her tooth was giving her. At some point, you're in so much pain that a deal with hell itself seemed like a good idea. The surgeon was quick, the meds were... well, they were worth it. When Sable awoke her clothes were cleaned, her tooth restored, and she was washed, scrubbed, de-blemished, and slathered in skin treatments until she shown like a pearl.

Then Merrick let her walk wherever she wished. She got to learn about where he was currently stationed.

Especially when it came in the form a rave filled party with every freeform delight she could forget herself with. The music pounded in her ears and crushed her body with force of the oppressive soundwaves resonating through her body.
