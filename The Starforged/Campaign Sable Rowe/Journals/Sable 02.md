Remembering where girly pop is here. Looks like we need to finish up this journey and get to wherever she's going.

Let's begin

Sable spat into the sink in the lavatory and another piece of her tooth fell into the basic. Tears were running down her face as she dug at her gums trying to relieve herself of the pieces of bones that had become dislodged from her jaw. She spate again and held her mouth while she whined.

The ache had been getting worse over the day, only to wake her in a cold sweat and the most unimaginable pain she had ever remembered being in. He hadn't just chipped the tooth. She would have to get the thing worked on before infection settled in.

"I hate the fucking dentist..." she commiserated with the sad, disheveled, bloody image of her in the mirror.

It was time to move on.

The ramp clicked into place with a satisfying accordion of extending metal. 

“Glad to see you arrived safe my dear—“ 

Sable stopped in her tracks as she was met with a wall of personal and at the center of it was finely dressed man leaning on a cane. 

“Glad to see I’m safe too—if you’ll excuse me.” She disembarked and moved to retract the ramp.

She felt the cane rest firmly on her shoulder, “I appreciate your diligence, I’m Merrick Arden, you have my package.”

Sable turned back and forced a painful smile. “I have to confirm—you understand.”

“Of course, of course, Ganden—“ The rest went unsaid but entirely understood. A man with a datapad walked forward and showed Sable the face of it. Sable scanned the code and the confirmation popped up—this was Merrick Arden.

`iv-progress:Fulfill Your Vow|Courier Job: Glimmer Outpost|6|9|2|The Starforged/Campaign Sable Rowe/Progress/Sable/Courier Job Glimmer Outpost.md|move:starforged/quest/fulfill_your_vow`  `iv-ooc:I will make an iron bow a bit later. Makes sense this situation is complicated.` 

His cane clacked on the ground as he walked closer to her.

“I shall have my surgeon look at that.” His bent calloused fingers touched her bruised lip. “That boy did a number on this beautiful face.”

“How did—“

“Of course there was surveillance attached to the package. What kind of curator would I be if I didn’t keep a close eye on what I acquire. 
“Yes, I know about the Serrato man that was on your ship. You were careful and I’m understanding so all of forgiven, but best not to be so careless again.” He squeezed her jaw just enough to shoot pain through her skull, but she did her best not to wince too hard.

“The Courier Guild appreciates your understanding,” Sable shifted and worked to turn over the package.

`iv-ooc:I'm adding +2 to the Sojourn move due to the hit with a match from the journey move. `  `iv-move:Sojourn|Heart|3|1|2|5|3|move:starforged/recover/sojourn|adds=2(Strong Hit with a Match)`   `iv-move:Heal|Iron|4|2|0|8|2|move:starforged/recover/heal`  `iv-meter:Health|1|4`   `iv-move:Hearten|Heart|4|1|0|4|4|move:starforged/recover/hearten` 

"Walk with me," his demand was soft, warm, almost sounding like a suggestion, but it was anything but. Merrick didn't seem like the kind of person to be refused. "You are an impressive pilot Sable."

"Thank you." Sable waited in anticipation for whatever that compliment was going to cost her. She might well be a warm biscuit for how he was buttering her up.

"You were attacked were you not?"

"I was. I evaded the situation." She replied.

"Very well, but even I can see that this frontier can be—demanding." He was choosing his words carefully.

They wound through the crowded streets and Merrick talked with Sable about her ship. How he had noticed the damage done to it and how apologetic he was for how hard fought the journey was. It wasn't. He knew that, and so did Sable. This was an act. He ingratiated himself to her, offering all sorts of services in exchange for how well she done on the job. He didn't need to do that, he paid her the compensation that was required, he didn't need to pay her anything else, but the kindness she received today would come at a great cost.

But she fell for it. At the time she blamed it on the pain her tooth was giving her. At some point, you're in so much pain that a deal with hell itself seemed like a good idea. The surgeon was quick, the meds were... well, they were worth it. When Sable awoke her clothes were cleaned, her tooth restored, and she was washed, scrubbed, de-blemished, and slathered in skin treatments until she shown like a pearl.

Then Merrick let her walk wherever she wished. She got to learn about where he was currently stationed.

`iv-oracle:Planetary Class|81|Rocky World|oracle_rollable:starforged/planet/class`  `iv-entity-create:Planet Oracles > Rocky World|Ory|The Starforged/Locations/Planets/Ory.md`  `iv-entity-create:Settlement|Meridian|The Starforged/Locations/Settlements/Meridian.md` 

Meridian was a busy industrial settlement on a large lifeless planet called Ory. Merrick said whatever life had lived here long ago was far gone. It’s been theorized that their corpses reacted to chemical storm causing the crystalline structures along the planets surface and their biomaterial rotted into a highly volatile fuel source. Though the stability of it is still being tested and hasn't been incorporated into a marketable fuel blend yet, the industry around it has already created a lively local economy.

Those who lived here were a mix of wealthy merchants and highly paid workers who were both collecting the raw material and refining here planetside in Meridian. Then there was the engineers, scientists, and biologists who had taken residence up either working for the refinery or studying the planets phenomenon. 

Merrick seemed to be well connected, but not the manager of this operation. His intrigue stayed with the crystals. Sable felt like there was something more he kept his ears perked for, but he was keeping that close to his chest.

Sable knew at this point she should have left. Thanked him for all he had done and proceeded on her way. When they got back to her ship he had it half taken apart. New panels for the ones that had been torn off, he had the targeting computer replaced with something more automated and easier to use, and a whole service was being perform. She tried to refuse, using every excuse she could, but Merrick had an excuse for every single one.

Merrick wasn't paying for anything, he just had a technician contact the Courier Guild and negotiate maintenance requests Sable had been neglecting. With the proper form filled out and an outside contractor handling the repairs she was in a even harder position to say no.

She was trapped and the fall came even harder when he released her to the wild of Meridian's night life. The music pounded in her ears and crushed her body with force of the oppressive soundwaves resonating through her body. The antigrav dancefloor let her lose herself to the motions of the music until she was wasted and forgetting anything important.

Sable woke the next morning entangled with some forgotten name still bundled in the sheets. She gathered her things and made her way bleary eyed to the closest place to get food then off to find her ship, can of steaming noodles in hand.

**INT. COURIER-479 CARGO HOLD**

"Ganden," Sable addressed the casual intruder, "what brings you aboard my ship?"

"I have a package for you to deliver." He was a quiet man with a low resonating tone.

"I'll check my datapad." Sable unclicked it from the wall and sure enough there was an official request. "Merrick sending something else out?"

"This is personal. Merrick has nothing to do with this." He said softly, his eyes shifting almost shamefully.

"I understand." Sable clicked her courier tag to the datapad and accepted the job.

**INT. CR-479 COCKPIT**

The little device lit up with all sorts of lights and warning as she swept her ship. She got to a panel inside the cockpit and her scanner flashed a warning. She reached up under the panel and pulled out a box, inside was another scanner of some kind and a holonote.

```
Sable,

I'm glad to see you are taking notable precautions. However your scanner is out of date, thusly I have provided one for you to use if you so wish.

Regards,
Merrick

How deep would this relationship go?  `iv-move:Make a Connection|Heart|3|1|0|10|1|move:starforged/connection/make_a_connection`  `iv-track-create:Merrick Arden|The Starforged/Campaign Sable Rowe/Progress/Sable/Merrick Arden.md` 

Sable groaned and shut the device back in the box and hid it in the deepest cubby hole she could find in her ship. She then charted a course out and left Ory and Meridian behind. She would have to find someone trustworthy to look through her ship and see if all is safe, she consulted her navmaps.
