# Backstory
Sable is a courier liker her father and mother before her. They purchased an incubated child as a retirement plan late in life. By the time Sable was in her mid 20's she was changing their diapers. It was a quiet life filled with the stories of her parents adventures together and at the end of it all they said riches awaited young Sable. All she had to do was find their old courier ship.
