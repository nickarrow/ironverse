BACKSTORY

A long time ago, there was a group of people that wanted to combine technology and magic in order to bring order to chaos.  And so, they built the precognition machine.  The machine was designed to know when order needed a helping hand, and create the exact right person to set things straight.  The machine could see the future, you see, and used advanced cloning techniques to create powerful agents of order whose fate, and thus victory, was preordained.  But like I said.  That was a long time ago.  The group has long since been forgotten, and the precognition machine has stood idle for generations.  I say that, but it did spit out that Jett fella not so long ago.  He's hardly a super-soldier built for heroics, though, is he?
