# [[The Starforged]]
This campaign is setup to be played in the standard Starforged setting, except it includes the recommended Sundered Isle's assets and a few Sundered Isles oracles that I think work really well in Starforged (Magnitude, size, weather, etc.). 

I've also set this campaign up to be an [[Epistolary Guide|Epistolary]] game with a shared vow of [[Expose the darkness behind the attacks across the sector and stop it from spreading]]. Barille has sent his first message marking progress on the vow ([[Message 01 - Barille Black]]) - feel free to join in on the fun and help complete this shared vow!

Otherwise, you can also just read the latest adventures of [[Barille Black]]:
