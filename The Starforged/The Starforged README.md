# [[The Starforged README]]
This shared universe of Starforged is setup to be played in the standard Starforged setting, except it includes the recommended Sundered Isle's assets and a few Sundered Isles oracles that I think work really well in Starforged (Magnitude, size, weather, etc.). I've also added [Starsmith](https://playeveryrole.com/starsmith-products/), and [Ancient Wonders](https://ludicpen.itch.io/ancient-wonders) content because they are so freaking cool. 

I've also set this campaign up to be an [[Epistolary Guide|Epistolary]] game with a shared vow to: 
![[Expose the darkness behind the attacks across the sector and stop it from spreading]]

## Here are the messages sent to date:
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link as "Epistoary Messages", file.mtime as "Last Updated"
WHERE contains(file.name, "Message")
```

Feel free to join in on the fun and help complete this shared vow!

## Current Players and Journals
We currently have several players in this univers, [[Echo 'Phantom' Stirling]], [[Tybalt-Yhen Serrato]], [[Sable Rowe]], [[Jett Foley]], and [[Barille Black]]. Feel free to read along on their respective journals! 

```dataview
