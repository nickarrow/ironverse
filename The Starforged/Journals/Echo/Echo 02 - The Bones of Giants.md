# Echo 02 - The Bones of Giants
#### PRESENT
##### INT. MAUSEFORT - AN ENDLESS DROP INTO THE VOID

`iv-noroll:Begin a Session|move:starforged/session/begin_a_session`  `iv-meter:Momentum|6|7`  `iv-oracle:Begin a Session|92|Unforeseen aid is on the way or within reach|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/session/begin_a_session.begin_a_session`  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|91|Ancient Obstacle|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` 

Echo was falling. She was falling and couldn't see where to for the life of her.
>Is the ground approaching? Is there any ground at all? I need to see!

She tried to still her mind and quell the rising panic and let her left arm out, if she timed it right-  `iv-move:Secure an Advantage|Edge|6|2|0|4|8|move:starforged/adventure/secure_an_advantage` 
She managed to flip on herself and get a glimpse down: no ground, just infinite fall, but she's seen an enormous shard of bone, what looked like the femur of a giant ten times bigger than her, that was protruding in the drop. She shook the thin grappling rope and readied herself, and as soon as she passed by it-  `iv-move:Face Danger|Wits|2|3|1|4|9|move:starforged/adventure/face_danger|adds=1(Echo sees what's coming and has a plan!)` 
The grappling hook sunk into the surface, the rope tensed and Echo shoot off, the tension making her rebound and land, hard, on the bone's surface.  `iv-meter:Health|5|4` 
She hissed and waited a moment before standing up. 
>At least nothing's broken. Now to see if there's any way forward from here. `iv-meter:Momentum|7|8`

##### INT. MAUSEFORT - GIANT BONES HALL

`iv-move:Explore a Waypoint|Wits|6|3|0|5|2|move:starforged/exploration/explore_a_waypoint`  `iv-meter:Momentum|8|9` 
The trip over the bone surface looming over endless void was short, but terrifying, and she felt only relief at stepping past a threshold and on solid ground (bone?) again, even when the shadow of the rest of the giant skeleton fell over her and, looking up, she saw the metal twisted through it. This must have been one of the creatures "made for war" on the planet's surface, the fall must have taken her closer.
`iv-track-advance:Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass.md|8|12|formidable|1` 
She climbed up the bones to see better what laid around her.  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|6|3|0|6|1|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information`  `iv-oracle:Action + Theme|88|Locate Relationship|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme`  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|72|Unnatural Mechanism|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` 
Her eyes lit up on a single patterned tile in the smooth bone, up over the giant skull, and then on the opposing side of the large room, where a glimmer of light revealed a similar pattern in a dark red gemstone, where the outline of a passage was barely visible in the wall. 
```
ECHO
Looks like the climbing is continuing.
```
`iv-move:Face Danger|Edge|5|2|0|9|4|move:starforged/adventure/face_danger`  `iv-meter:Momentum|9|8` 
It took a while, Echo almost tripped a few times, and her bruised back was clearly making itself heard, but soon she found herself on top of the skull and pressed the pattern, hoping for the best.
She wasn't an archaeologist of any kind, would this even work? `iv-oracle:50/50|26|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty`  

##### INT. MAUSEFORT - RUINED CORRIDOR

`iv-move:Undertake an Expedition|Wits|2|3|0|9|8|move:starforged/exploration/undertake_an_expedition`  
`iv-oracle:Action + Theme|25|Begin Corruption|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme`  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|28|Mechanical Remains|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` 
The moment Echo stepped past the threshold the guns of the half-destroyed combat droid, mostly in pieces but for its weapon capabilities, were on her and she froze.
The corridor itself was much dustier, the bone enamel broken and not smooth at all, with smaller chunks of bone that reminded her of the statues that had come to life earlier.
Its speaker croaked to life, metallic and shrill.
```
DROID
Halt!
```
Echo did, her hands going up even as she caught the symbol on the side of its head.

> Does she recognize the symbol on the droid?
>`iv-oracle:50/50|11|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 
> Is it one of our known factions?
 `iv-oracle:50/50|9|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 
 > 1 - Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds, 2 - Circle of the Elder Stars, 3- Household Serrato, 4- Risen union
 >  `iv-dice:1d4|4`
