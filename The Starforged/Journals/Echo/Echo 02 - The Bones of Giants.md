# Echo 02 - The Bones of Giants
#### PRESENT
##### INT. MAUSEFORT - AN ENDLESS DROP INTO THE VOID

`iv-noroll:Begin a Session|move:starforged/session/begin_a_session`  `iv-meter:Momentum|6|7`  `iv-oracle:Begin a Session|92|Unforeseen aid is on the way or within reach|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/session/begin_a_session.begin_a_session`  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|91|Ancient Obstacle|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` 

Echo was falling. She was falling and couldn't see where to for the life of her.
>Is the ground approaching? Is there any ground at all? I need to see!

She tried to still her mind and quell the rising panic and let her left arm out, if she timed it right-  `iv-move:Secure an Advantage|Edge|6|2|0|4|8|move:starforged/adventure/secure_an_advantage` 
She managed to flip on herself and get a glimpse down: no ground, just infinite fall, but she's seen an enormous shard of bone, what looked like the femur of a giant ten times bigger than her, that was protruding in the drop. She shook the thin grappling rope and readied herself, and as soon as she passed by it-  `iv-move:Face Danger|Wits|2|3|1|4|9|move:starforged/adventure/face_danger|adds=1(Echo sees what's coming and has a plan!)` 
The grappling hook sunk into the surface, the rope tensed and Echo shoot off, the tension making her rebound and land, hard, on the bone's surface.  `iv-meter:Health|5|4` 
She hissed and waited a moment before standing up. 
>At least nothing's broken. Now to see if there's any way forward from here. `iv-meter:Momentum|7|8`

##### INT. MAUSEFORT - GIANT BONES HALL

`iv-move:Explore a Waypoint|Wits|6|3|0|5|2|move:starforged/exploration/explore_a_waypoint`  `iv-meter:Momentum|8|9` 
The trip over the bone surface looming over endless void was short, but terrifying, and she felt only relief at stepping past a threshold and on solid ground (bone?) again, even when the shadow of the rest of the giant skeleton fell over her and, looking up, she saw the metal twisted through it. This must have been one of the creatures "made for war" on the planet's surface, the fall must have taken her closer.
`iv-track-advance:Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass.md|8|12|formidable|1` 
She climbed up the bones to see better what laid around her.  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|6|3|0|6|1|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information`  `iv-oracle:Action + Theme|88|Locate Relationship|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme`  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|72|Unnatural Mechanism|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` 
Her eyes lit up on a single patterned tile in the smooth bone, up over the giant skull, and then on the opposing side of the large room, where a glimmer of light revealed a similar pattern in a dark red gemstone, where the outline of a passage was barely visible in the wall. 
```
ECHO
Looks like there's more climbing to do.
```
`iv-move:Face Danger|Edge|5|2|0|9|4|move:starforged/adventure/face_danger`  `iv-meter:Momentum|9|8` 
It took a while, Echo almost tripped a few times, and her bruised back was clearly making itself heard, but soon she found herself on top of the skull and pressed the pattern, hoping for the best.
She wasn't an archaeologist of any kind, would this even work? `iv-oracle:50/50|26|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty`  

##### INT. MAUSEFORT - RUINED CORRIDOR

`iv-move:Undertake an Expedition|Wits|2|3|0|9|8|move:starforged/exploration/undertake_an_expedition`  
`iv-oracle:Action + Theme|25|Begin Corruption|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme`  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|28|Mechanical Remains|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` 
The moment Echo stepped past the threshold the guns of the half-destroyed combat droid, mostly in pieces but for its weapon capabilities, were on her and she froze.
The corridor itself was much dustier, the bone enamel broken and not smooth at all, with smaller chunks of bone that reminded her of the statues that had come to life earlier.
Its speaker croaked to life, metallic and shrill.
```
DROID
Halt!
```
Echo did, her hands going up even as she caught the symbol on the side of its head.

> Does she recognize the symbol on the droid? `iv-oracle:50/50|11|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 
> Is it one of our known factions?  `iv-oracle:50/50|9|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 
 > 1 - Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds, 2 - Circle of the Elder Stars, 3- Household Serrato, 4- Risen union  `iv-dice:1d4|4`
 > The symbol?  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|23|Guarded Energy|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` 

The symbol on the droid's chassis was one that Echo had seen many times in her travels through the forge, the yellow shield with a white rein in its center of the [[Risen Union]], but the model wasn't familiar. 
> Fair enough, from the amount of bone dust on it... It's positively ancient.

 `iv-oracle:Initial Disposition|13|Friendly|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/initial_disposition`Usually when she'd met their members they'd been enigmatic, but generally friendly, if distant. She cleared her throat and twitched when the droid's firearm swayed a little more in her direction.

```
ECHO
Don't shoot! I'm not an enemy, the statues attacked me too!
```
`iv-move:Compel|Heart|2|2|0|5|4|move:starforged/adventure/compel|burn=8:2`  
Echo saw its lens scan her from head to toe and analyze her person for signs of battle: whatever it was that the droid saw, its weapon lowered. `iv-meter:Momentum|2|3` 

```
DROID
Condition- Critical. Assistance required. 

ECHO
Sure, I'll... try and repair you. I can't work miracles though. What were you even doing here?
```
She took out her equipment and started lining up the, admittedly sparse, robotic repair kit she usually brought with her, showing it to the Droid as they talked.
`iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|5|3|0|9|10|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information` 
>Were they trying to find the Hourglass too?  `iv-oracle:50/50|14|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` Were they involved in the planet's war?  `iv-oracle:50/50|59|No|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` Does the droid know current orders?  `iv-oracle:50/50|21|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` Is the RU still now searching for the Hourglass?  `iv-oracle:50/50|93|No|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 

In its grating, halting speech, the droid told her more that she thought it would: about how the Risen Union of decades past had been searching for the Hourglass in here, how most of the team inside had been attacked and died and only a few had managed to flee. How it had been monitoring the RU's frequencies ever since, but couldn't communicate its own status due to a broken comm unit, and had to spectate as the ones fleeing from here formed their own splinter group, obsessed with finding the Hourglass, among other relics and precursor technologies, to their own end.
Were this splinter group the ones she was 'supposed to stop'? Well, if she took it first they'd never *begin* anything in the first place.
`iv-track-advance:Stop those who want to take the Hourglass|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Stop those who want to take the Hourglass.md|0|8|dangerous|1` 
She'd first have to see where this machine stood, of course.
`iv-move:Secure an Advantage|Wits|4|3|0|2|10|move:starforged/adventure/secure_an_advantage` 
```
DROID
I recently recognized once again their speech patterns in the comm channels. It's statistically likely that they are infiltrating the Risen Union and searching again.

ECHO
And what about you? Where do you stand about the Hourglass?

DROID
My loyalty to the Risen Union is programmed. I will complete my last mission, unless my orders change.

ECHO
Got it! Makes sense.
```

Echo tried to make it sound cheerful even as she prepared to fake with everything she had. It looked like she'd have to *repair* the droid's issued to death. She warned it that she was beginning and took her tools.  `iv-move:Face Danger|Shadow|4|1|1|2|5|move:starforged/adventure/face_danger|adds=1(Echo now knows that this droid is the enemy)`  `iv-meter:Momentum|3|4`  `iv-move:Repair|Wits|6|3|0|6|2|move:starforged/recover/repair` 

Echo was extremely thankful that this unit was so old, she was sweating by the time she'd finished, after disabling its comm unit completely and talking it into believing that she was doing it simply for the repairs. She watched the chassis fall to the ground completely inert as the computational unit was removed, then took the data storage and hid it inside her suit, to look at once outside the Vault and its many nightmares.

She readied her blade and steadied her breath, and looked down towards the rest of the corridor and its grey shadows. There was no time to dwadle.

##### INT. MAUSEFORT - RUINED CORRIDOR, DEEPER
`iv-move:Undertake an Expedition|Wits|6|3|0|7|6|move:starforged/exploration/undertake_an_expedition` 
`iv-track-advance:Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass.md|12|16|formidable|1` 
`iv-oracle:Interior Feature|40|Looted or dismantled technology|oracle_rollable:starforged/precursor_vault/interior/feature` 

Echo proceeded forward, stepping over the remains of that decades-old battle between the enamel-covered undead and the RU splinter faction, closing her eyes every once in a while to give all her focus to the bell tones, trying to understand the next steps forward.
`iv-move:Secure an Advantage|Wits|4|3|0|4|10|move:starforged/adventure/secure_an_advantage`  `iv-meter:Momentum|4|6` 
She could feel the old robotic parts littering the ground, see the old pieces of ammo and weapon, the discarded archaic-looking armor with the shield-and-reindeer emblem on it. She simply followed the trail of the old battle deeper forward, feeling the deep bell-tones resonate in her bones.
>Will she search for further info?  `iv-oracle:50/50|93|No|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 

Echo gave the passage one last look as she felt the bell-tones shift towards one specific door. She could search further, if she wanted to, and maybe she'd find something useful. But the hair on the back of her neck was standing up, and she could feel something in the winds of the beyond slither forward: something was paying her too much attention right now. 
Echo didn't want to linger here. She stepped forward.

##### INT. MAUSEFORT - ANCIENT WAREHOUSE
`iv-move:Undertake an Expedition|Wits|6|3|0|1|6|move:starforged/exploration/undertake_an_expedition` 
`iv-track-advance:Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass.md|16|20|formidable|1` 
`iv-oracle:Interior Feature|298|Looted storage facility, Inscrutable object lies dark and silent|oracle_rollable:starsmith/vaults/interior/feature` 

The dust, shining vortices in the still air, greeted Echo as she walked in the opening. Shelves protruded out from the walls, made of bone and mostly empty, some destroyed. Some things had been left behind by whoever had been here first and had emptied the place, and Echo could understand why: at a quick glance she couldn't even guess their use. 
```
ECHO
Why here, you damn bell? Is there even another door here?
```

She clicked on the lights from her insulation suit and detached them, lifting them up into the air with a command on her comm unit to reveal the vast room, and looked around.

`iv-move:Explore a Waypoint|Wits|4|3|1|5|6|move:starforged/exploration/explore_a_waypoint`  `iv-meter:Momentum|6|7` 
Echo scanned the place carefully, before her attention was pulled to the unseeing... nothingness in the far corner of the vast space: if not for the out-of-tune wavering of the bells that had been her constant companions inside the Vault, she wouldn't be able to see it. As it was, even as she walked towards it almost involuntary, she couldn't focus her eyes on it. 
`iv-track-advance:Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass.md|20|28|formidable|2` 

Was this the Hourglass? `iv-oracle:Likely|47|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.likely`  
Something in the sound over the winds beyond answered her unspoken thoughts: yes. We brought you here, you wanted this Hourglass, here it is; that something seemed to say. Echo didn't know if she could call that feeling, that almost-voice, friendly.

`iv-progress:Finish an Expedition|Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass|7|6|7|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass.md|move:starforged/exploration/finish_an_expedition`  `iv-track-complete:Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Find your way through the Mausefort to the Hourglass.md`  `iv-track-advance:Take the Hourglass relic and keep it safe|The Starforged/Progress/Echo/Take the Hourglass relic and keep it safe.md|4|8|formidable|1`  `iv-meter:Momentum|7|9`

>[!note] Notes
>I didn't want to leave this HERE but I need to ruuuuun and do stuff. Writing the idea down so I can remember it when I come back, soooo if anyone reading doesn't want to be spoiled, don't read the next note.
>Also, I changed the vow name because it needed some more stuff in there, and keeping the hourglass safe was implied in what I was intending anyway.

>[!SPOILER]- The next stuff
>So essentially, Echo REACHED the hourglass, but has to TAKE it first, and since we got a weak hit, something has to happen here. With the oracle rolls I got, I'm thinking of a psyco-something manifestation of her fears of some day misusing her gift rising out of the 'winds' of the afterlife. She probably fears something taking control of her, or removing her agency somehow (blackmail? lobotomy? magic?) to essentially use her negromancy and the tech of the First Light to bring people back from the dead endlessly, maybe even in the 'body snatcher' kinda way. Who wouldn't want to rob the body of a very rich, healthy, clan leader? 
>She's going to be doing either a battle or as scene challenge, I'm leaning more towards the latter, where essentially she's confronted with what her power could be used for, and has to claw back to 'reality', maybe losing some amount of sanity in the middle there.
>This whole thing is probably connected to the 'something's watching' feeling she had in the corridor.
