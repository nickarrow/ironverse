TWO DAYS AGO
INT. THE FIRST LIGHT IRONHOME

[[Echo 'Phantom' Stirling]] stepped past the airlock to the Ironhome for the first time since her escape from the cloning chambers and laid her eyes on the one who'd called her in. 
```iron-vault-mechanics

Vesper was as old as he'd ever been, as richly dressed in all esoteric symbols and fabric, smiling his warm smile as long white hair fell loosely on his weathered but still welcoming expression.

````
VESPER
Welcome, my dear, welcome! I must say, it's good to see your face, I remember fondly when your progenitor was as young as you...

ECHO
Progenitor, is this what we're calling it? It's not like I was meant to be her child, or her anything at all. So. What is it?

VESPER
Well, someone in the vaults is feeling talkative, and this is where I'd have called in your progenitor, but she's in the vaults too, now.

ECHO
I'm not her, you know that, yes? I'm a clone, not a replica.

VESPER
You still carry the gift and would have a home here, if you wanted it.

ECHO
The answer is no, once more. But... thank you. Lead on?
````

Echo followed him to the deepest parts of the First Light, where the ones traveling in the Long Voyage had started keeping their dead, preserved, and still continued to do so. Echo completely ignored the remains of her progenitor with aplomb, as she'd done since the first and last time they'd talked since her death, when the spirit had insisted that there was a very powerful relic in the deepest recesses of the galaxy that would awaken forces unknown, and that she, specifically, needed to find it. So she'd sworn to [[Find the lost relic and understand my connection to it]] and she'd gone away, twirling the black iron cards she'd found.

They stopped in front of the well-preserved corpse's alcove where Echo could see clear manifestations of unrest, the chill of space now much more prevalent and pungent. 
Vesper gestured to the body, explaining that this was his own grandfather, who apparently had urgent business, even in death.
Echo focussed inwards and then out, bringing the eerie sounds of the spiritual winds rushing through the Ironhome, like a cold, damp wind, and suddenly Roman Savela opened his eyes once more and talked, voice creaking like old, dusty paper.

````
ECHO
I am Phantom. You called me. What has awakened you from your rest, spirit? Talk.

ROMAN
The attack, its waves... they spread.

ECHO
Which attack, Roman Vesper? 

ROMAN
Ackriss-2, and its horrors. The waves woke me up, and will wake more. It will wake the Hourglass, too. Take it, Phantom, or someone else will. 

ECHO
I will. I promise this. Where is it?

ROMAN
Vesper knows. 
````

> Well, isn't that a cheery way to end the conversation? 
> Luckily I've learnt to accept it when spirits do stuff like this.

I spin the dark iron card in my hand, making the Skeleton face Vesper, and I wait for the old man to find the information.

(To do next: create the vault, eventual system and planet. Next scene takes us there.)
