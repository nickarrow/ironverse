# [[Barille 02 - Reck]]

`iv-noroll:Begin a Session|move:starforged/session/begin_a_session`  `iv-meter:Momentum|5|6` 

EXT. SNUB FIGHTER 27 REENTRY TO ACKRISS-2

The 27 bursts through the purple and green clouds of [[Ackriss-2]]. Scans are showing a toxic atmosphere and remnants of ash. Likely from regular volcanic eruptions. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
This is SN27 on approach, anyone down there?

NO RESPONSE
```

> [[Reck]] itself is built into the rock cliffs of a large canyon. The rock providing a natural shield from the harsh atmosphere. A settlement supporting thousands, out in the frontier of the Expanse. 

Barille circles the settlement, and sees an impact crater and wreckage. It looks like the attacking frigate crashed into the settlement on the south side. Not good. Smoke is coming out of the wreckage. 

Barille eyes what looks like a landing port nearby. The auto-landing sequence takes over, and Barille tries to ping the transport ship. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
Hey, did you make it down here? Any injured. This is Barille. 

COMMS OFFICER
Reading you Barille, yeah, we’re all in one piece. That was you in the fighter right? 

BARILLE BLACK
Yeah, any idea who that was?

COMMS OFFICER
They transmitted a pretty long message, something about the Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds? That mean anything to you?

BARILLE BLACK
Nope. Never heard of them. Trouble is, the suicided into Reck, so I guess we can’t ask them. I can't raise anyone down there, trouble?

COMMS OFFICER
Yeah, the impact shook the entire canyon and its been pretty much disaster mode down here. Reck is pretty wild on a good day, but the suicide attack has everyone either panicked or fighting fires. 

BARILLE BLACK
Got it. Thanks for the info. Barille out. 
```

> So we have a name. `iv-entity-create:Faction|Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds|The Starforged/Factions/Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds.md` A bit of a mouthful, and clearly not the most inconspicuous bunch. 

Barille check's to see if the landing has an automated repair system. Negative. Okay, can I send a message? 

```
BARILLE BLACK - Typing via hand terminal
*Landing bay 17, SN27 - Barille Black, requesting repairs.* 

Yeah, I'm going to need to talk to someone. 
```

 > Okay, so that’s fine. Need to start investigating for the [[Risen Union]] anyway. Let's go for a walk. 

Before leaving Barille sends out an encoded wideband broadcast.  `iv-noroll:Reach a Milestone|move:starforged/quest/reach_a_milestone` 

![[Message 01 - Barille Black]]

INT. LANDING PORT WITH 27 PARKED AND RELEASEING STEAM

Barille get's out of his fighter and sets off. He reflects on the little bit of information he has about the so called "horrors" of Reck. The job just stated "terrifying manifestations" not a lot to go on. Need to ask around. And someone has gone missing, let's find anyone in charge.  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|1|2|0|9|4|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information` 

> What is the dire threat or unwelcome truth?  `iv-oracle:Action + Theme|68|Journey Opportunity|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme` Reck is a frontier settlement with an *obvious social stratification*. It looks like there may be a bit of a revolution happening, and Barille just found himself smack in the middle of it. Good luck getting your ship repaired any time soon, and also...  `iv-oracle:Pay the Price|98|Your vehicle suffers damage, Your action causes collateral damage or has an unintended effect|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/pay_the_price.pay_the_price` 
> 
> Looks like my message has attracted the wrong kind of attention. 

A sudden crash and screeching of metal is heard from behind Barille, in the landing bay. He runs back to see the large grapple hook digging into the side of the 27. `iv-meter:Snub Fighter / Integrity|2|1` 

There's also a small group of folk that have gathered, scavengers or otherwise and two big guys step in front of Barille. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
Hey friends, seems like you have gone and put a hook into my ship. 

SCAVENGER 1
I think you mean our ship. You picked the wrong day to show up, we control the entire east ward now. 

BARILLE BLACK
Yeah, that's fine. *Barille pulls out a cigarette and lites it* You can have the east ward, but I'm going to need my ship. How about, you ungrapple it and we don't have to turn this into a... thing.
```

`iv-move:Compel|Heart|5|3|0|4|5|move:starforged/adventure/compel`  `iv-meter:Momentum|6|7` 

```
SCAVENGER 1
Huh. I figured you we're just going to try and pull a gun and... look if you stay out of our way, you can keep this ship. Looks pretty beat up anyway. Just remember, the east ward is ours.

BARILLE BLACK
Got it. And who is "Us" exactly? 

SCAVENGER 1
We're with "Murad", and she owns it. Got that!

BARILLE BLACK
Understood. *Takes a long drag on the *cigarette*, congrats to her. 
```

Murad's scavengers drop their tools and then push past Barille, pushing him as they pass. Barille looks at the claw still stuck in the side of his fighter.

> Ugh, this is going to cost me. He thinks to himself.

`iv-oracle:Interlude Scene|34|Fight in a sparring match|oracle_rollable:sundered_isles/misc/interlude_scene` Barille finishes his cigarette and then proceeds to begin stretching. He practices a form, and then works up a sweat. All the while, thinking through the current situation. Reck, on the brink of rebellion. Whoever this "Murad" is, staking a claim. The transport ship and the attacking and suicidal pirates. He then thinks back to the [[Circle of the Elder Stars|Circle]] and his vow to [[Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars|establish a new noble house in the Circle]]. You can't ever really leave the Circle, but he is done working for others, doing their dirty work. 

Barille sets off.  `iv-track-advance:Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck|The Starforged/Progress/Barille/Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck.md|0|4|formidable|1` 

INT. CROWDED CORRIDORS OF RECK

Barille needs to find a lead for the missing person. Or whatever these "manifestations" are. He checks his hand terminal UI.  `iv-entity-create:NPC|Rowena Jensen|The Starforged/Characters/Rowena Jensen.md` is the local contact. Let's start there.  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|4|2|0|1|4|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information`  `iv-meter:Momentum|7|9` 

While looking at Rowena's profile, he immediate gets a ping from her.

```
ROWENA JENSEN - TEXT MESSAGE
Mr. Black - RU said you we're coming, so I've been monitoring for a proximity alert. Reck is always kind of a disaster, but today has been bigger than normal. I'm tied up in other work, but here's what I know. Ping me when you've got something.

*data file attached*

-message ends
```

> **Info on the missing person:**  `iv-oracle:Action + Theme|22|Deflect Religion|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme` Karthick Hunter, a colleague to Rowena has gone missing. There is a strong religion that permeates the upper classes of Reck, and Karthick was a true believer. 
> 
> Recently, Karthick had started showing up late for work, and when he was there, he was not focused on it, instead he had started to become obsessed with the religion. `iv-oracle:Story Clue|21|Evokes a remarkable anomaly or phenomenon|oracle_rollable:starforged/misc/story_clue` So much so, and then one day he just disappeared. Like, every trace of him. His apartment, rented out. His personnel files, deleted. There is simply no record of him anywhere! Local authorities were no help (and generally only existed for the upper classes anyway), and nobody seems to have any answers as to where he is.  
> 
> Info on the horrifying manifestations:  `iv-oracle:Descriptor+Focus|17|Deadly Portal|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/descriptorfocus` There have always been rumors on Reck. Its a frontier settlement, built into the bedrock of a toxic and violent planet. Going outside is rarely undertaken, and often perilous. Lately though, the rumors seem to center around voids that simply snatch people out of existence. Nobody has been able to document such portals, and most think it is just a rumor. Except now Karthick has gone missing.

EXT. RECK MARKET

With new key information in hand. Barille leans against a pillar in a larger marketplace. The lights are dimming (simulated sunset), and the market is starting to come alive with vendors. There is still a lot of folks hustling around, but it is hard to tell if this is in response to the frigate's suicide attack, or just the normal for Reck. 

Barille sits and watches the market for a while, looking for something to catch his eye, or maybe just an outdoor pub to get a drink....

One drink.

Barille finds a seat at a placed called the  `iv-oracle:Name|265|Pinched Penny|oracle_rollable:starsmith/starships/name` He orders a drink and then turns around, back to the bar. He's eyeing up the people here, trying to get a sense of the place.  `iv-oracle:Descriptor|83|Ruined|oracle_rollable:starsmith/core/descriptor` Yeah, it's seen better days. And now it seems that this settlement might be on the brink of collapse. Or... you know, it could just be one of those days. ^Pinched-Penny

`iv-ooc:Trying to figure out the next steps for Barille. I am thinking another Gather Information, or possibly even an expedition to go on a clue hunt. ` 

Barille reviews the data file, the image of Karthick. Time to go for a walk, and he heads towards Karthick's former apartment.  `iv-ooc:Is Barille getting closer to the suicide crash site?`  `iv-oracle:50/50|14|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty`  

After about 10 min of walking, Barille sees flashing lights and alert messages pinging his hand terminal.  `iv-oracle:Story Clue|186|Uncovers a damaging secret involving a secondary threat|oracle_rollable:starsmith/misc/story_clue` Barille proceeds forward, and then suddenly realizes he's completely alone. There should be fire crews, or other people here, but there isn't. There's... nobody. He's in a residency district, and about block away from Karthick's former apartment.  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|1|2|0|6|4|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information|burn=9:2` that's when he sees  `iv-oracle:Action + Theme|69|Summon Rumor|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme` the very solid wall in front of him twist in upon itself and a blaze of blue fire twisting open what appears to be a portal.

The portal slowly expands, and inside of it there is first an abyss of nothing, but then a craggy rockface appears, it is a though Barille is looking into some other world, through a window in the side of this very flex-steel building. As it all goes quiet, and then out of the portal steps a human, or something human like. 

`iv-oracle:Descriptor|189|Shocking|oracle_rollable:starsmith/core/descriptor`  `iv-oracle:Focus|275|Revolution|oracle_rollable:starsmith/core/focus` 


`iv-ooc:Threat one was these horrifying manifestations, threat two was the Ascendency. So, I am thinking that the Ascendency suicide problem is... catching? Yeah, I like that. `
