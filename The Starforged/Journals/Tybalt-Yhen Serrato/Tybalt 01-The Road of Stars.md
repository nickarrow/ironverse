CRIMSON DEEP SECTOR
HELIA-36, FURNACE WORLD EXTRACTION ORBITAL (POPULATION: ~23,000)
BANNERSWORN GARRISON, SPIRE 8

The sound of metal grinding against stone echoes through the empty barracks and covers the already habitually-silent tread of the visitor. With data-pad in hand he approaches the sole occupant of the barracks, a veritable slab of muscle that out-massed his guest even in fatigues. A metric pushed further along by his arms being heavy-duty augments. But not for Serrato bannersworn were the crude substitutes of a smelter worker, little different from a pipe with spindly digits on the end to drag out a person's utility. Instead they were earnest works of art, the plated exterior embellished in runes and symbols that marked him out as belonging to the Yhen family. And the fully articulated fingers continued working the black axe in their grasp against a mechanized grindstone as Tybalt-Yhen of Household Serrato addressed his second.

```
Tybalt: I hope you have a good reason to be disturbing me.

Paxel: Like you're doing anything, trying to sharpen black iron. Anyway, aren't you the one that wanted word on any leads on those pirates of yours?
```

That got him to stop his habitual sharpening, setting aside the ancient weapon he still wasn't sure he deserved yet while his other hand reached out to take the offered data-pad to skim through it's contents

```
Tybalt: Hmph. So you do have a good reason for disturbing me-

Paxel: As if I enjoy being subjected to melodrama.

Tybalt: -these sound exactly like the ones we are looking for. Making a suicide run on the nearest settlement when faced with defeat, AND possessing strange technology? A perfect match for the thousand or so pirates who just tried seizing the single biggest mining outpost in the Outlands.

Paxel: And if this "Barille" guy's lying?

Tybalt: Then I beat the tar out of him.
```

Cracking his neck, Tybalt inelegantly jabbed and prodded the screen of the data-pad to access the station's navigational charts to look up the names of the places mentioned in the [broadcast transcript](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Foundry&file=The%20Starforged%20(NickArrow)%2FLore%2FEpistolary%2FMessage%2001%20-%20Barille%20Black), already dreading the answer he would receive based on his unfamiliarity with the terms. 

(Does the navigational data still exist? 7 vs 75: Yes) Fortunately, as all the mineral wealth the thousands-strong labor force of Helia-36 extracted (Including it's harvests of precious, precious black iron) would be useless if they needed to re-learn their shipping routes every time, the physical medium where the data is held is enclosed within the Warlord's Palace upon the station, meant to be their residence whenever they visit for inspections that can span months owing to the sheer scale of the operation. And as is to be expected for the estate of a [ruling lord of a Founder Clan](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Foundry&file=The%20Starforged%20(NickArrow)%2FFactions%2FCircle%20of%20the%20Elder%20Stars), it's defenses were beyond the abilities of the pirates to breach, even if the latest one was a raid of rare magnitude.

```
Tybalt: Alright... Devil's Chain sector, found by settler fleet under Agryle Stubbs...damn their eyes, it's in the Expanse?

Paxel: That's...good?

Tybalt: As good as dysentery, you lizard-eyed fool! There's passages charted all the way there, but that would still take us two weeks to get there. This lead will be a month old by the time we even arrive!

Paxel: ...Does that mean we can stay put?

Tybalt: No. A bad lead is still a lead. But if the reach of this "Ascendancy" stretches out from the Expanse...we might have to share the Conclave's recognition.
```

The graveworlder folded his arms as he maintained eye contact, even when blinking, thanks to the transparent, vertical eyelids he possessed: The vagaries of generational radiation exposure and natural selection giving the man this reptilian mutation.

```
Paxel: Do I need to sit down for the history lesson? Because you speak like I should know what that means. 
```

Tybalt gestured at the wide, circular base of a nearby support pillar, and Paxel obliged by sitting down on it.

```
Tybalt: The High Constellation Conclave, or just 'The Conclave' for informal reference, is the ruling body of the Circle of the Elder Stars, the greatest of the Founder Clans of which you and your folk are now a part of-

Paxel: I'm guessing 'we' gave ourselves that nomination.

Tybalt: Obviously, but hush now. Membership in the conclave is restricted, granted only as a consequence of being a noble house of true relevance. It is not enough to be unchallenged in your own sliver of the Forge, you must be able to go anywhere in the Circle's domains and be regarded as someone who CANNOT be ignored. Our own master, the Warlord Serrato and the Forty-Eighth So Honored, holds a seat by virtue of a good third of noble houses depending upon kin-bands of Serrato warriors as bodyguards and shock-troops, and our majority ownership of the black iron that is harvested from the furnace world this station orbits

Paxel: And so you're trying to impress him by getting these guys?

Tybalt: To avenge their insult to us all. Household Serrato is the very tip of the spear that the Circle would wield against the other Founder Clans. If mere PIRATES can attack our most valuable fiefdom with impunity, we are nothing to fear. So bringing the Warlord the heads of their leaders would be a feat worthy of a hero worthy to helm the Kaal-Kaaz, once long-lost, with my finding it on your dead world the providence of fate.

Paxel: You didn't "find" that Purgatory, you crashlanded in a shuttle. I still don't believe the part where you say you stole it after fighting through a pirate ship with a crew over a hundred strong, once they reeled in your old corvette.

Tybalt: I don't care, it's the truth.

Paxel: ...Anyway, I guess you want me to get the folks ready to go?

Tybalt: Yes, prepare the Kaal-Kaaz for my arrival. I will don my warplate in the meantime. And pass a message to Reaver-Captain Epathus, tell him I wish to speak with him.

Paxel: Do I have to? The guy looked like he was sizing up how to kill me and my folks.

Tybalt: Do not fret, he does this with everyone.

Paxel: That. Doesn't. Help.

Tybalt: Just do as I say, no extra effort is required. He will not kill you just for existing.
```

As Paxel departed and Tybalt did as he said he would, he reflected upon what he just asked of his lieutenant. His relationship with Epathus was...[complicated](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Foundry&file=The%20Starforged%20(NickArrow)%2FCharacters%2FNPCs%2FEpathus-Barabas%20Serrato), going as far back as when both their fathers still lived. Tybalt's father had been the previous Reaver-Chief of the *Clarion Call,* one of Household Serrato's newer dreadnoughts, with Epathus' father being his second-in-command. Both had perished in a skirmish with another Founder Clan, over a Garden World in Terminus, when the ship they were boarding detonated their e-drive. 

```iron-vault-mechanics

- "![[The Starforged (NickArrow)\/Progress\/Find where he stands with Epathus.md|iv-embed]]"
```

"The *Clarion Call* was supposed to be mine." is a thought that still clings to Tybalt's mind. The surviving crew had held a vote from among the living and the heirs of the slain for command, as was tradition...but Tybalt did not even come close to contesting Epathus. 

If the latter was just that much better a warrior than him, that much better a leader, Tybalt could have accepted that. But he has won against him in the dueling rings as often as he has lost to him, and he heard as recently as a day ago of how the crew has needed to rein his excesses in, rather than the other way around.

Even the act of discovering the resting place of a ship that had seen the Exodus, and taking it for his own, had not made Tybalt any more willing to learn why he was the one his father's comrades had no faith in.

But time would not freeze for Tybalt to wallow in doubt, as the armor that enclosed him ceased to weigh upon him once the back-mounted power generator was activated. So when he exited the barracks into the teeming corridors of Helia-36, Tybalt strode as a towering golem of whirring servos and armor plating of archaic-motif. The very picture of a Serrato Bannersworn, the red-handed enforcers of the Conclave.

CRIMSON DEEP SECTOR
THE CLARION CALL, HOUSEHOLD SERRATO DREADNOUGHT
COMMAND BRIDGE

As the one seeking this meeting between captains, Tybalt was the one who went aboard Epathus' ship. Like many other vessels the Clarion Call had been recalled from it's previous assignments to serve as physical assurances to the other noble houses, that the recent attack that brought production to a grinding halt was an aberration, that would not be permitted again.

The bridge followed typical Serrato design-principles, in that in many ways it resembled some pre-Spacer throne-room, with melee weapons and boarding shields lining the walls beside Barabas and Serrato banners. Tybalt did not and would not look at the old hands that manned their stations, for this was still a spaceship despite appearances.

}
```
Epathus-Barabas lounged on his command throne before him in full warplate, helmet and all to obscure his expression, staring down at him like some Iron Age king through an unblinking visor. Tybalt had intended to gain his measure, to guess at his current mood so as to better sway him with words, but the realization of what he was doing made his blood run cold.

"*We had been brothers once, Epathus.*" Tybalt thought bitterly. "*When did we draw battle-lines between us?*"

Tybalt's attention would return to the man himself once he began speaking.

```
Epathus: So, what did you send your mutant to pester me for?

Tybalt: I have come to negotiate.

Epathus: So you've come to beg. Again.

Tybalt: I am sure the elders can attest that they witnessed me thrash yo-
```

Tybalt bit back his insult before it could emerge in full. He couldn't just pick a fight with Epathus here, not when the trail was so old
