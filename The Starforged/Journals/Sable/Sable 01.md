Where we left off...
Sable is a courier who has work her way in the ranks and was given the special task of expending the reach of the courier guild into an uncharted sector the Devil's Chain.
She has acquired her first notable job in the sector. Transporting a Black service shipment that marked Red, which means rush as fast as possible.
With this new resolves Sable has reaffirmed her mission to expand the Courier Guild's reach in the sector and live up to the legacy of her parents. I believe this calls Swear and Iron Vow and +1 Momentum for the start of the session.

Seeing as her first job started with her being unable to speak with the client a weak hit seems fitting. Something about the Courier Guild is they are neutral, their loyalty is to only the cargo they carry. When setting up new routes in uncharted sectors like this it's very crucial to prevent any one faction from monopolizing the courier's services. She will have to be careful going forward.

Let's begin

Sable clicked the datapad into place and her destination began populating her nav. Little lines raced across the screen as her course was charted. She sat down in her chair and began charging the e-drive for the journey. *Might as well call Leela.*

She fired up the commlink and perky young lady appeared with a forced smile. "Any information on the client in the registry?"
`iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|5|2|0|3|9|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information` 

"Uhhh not really, just a deposit slip and a name `iv-oracle:Given Name|70|Merrick|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/name/given_name`  `iv-oracle:Family Name|35|Arden|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/name/family_name`," Leela answered, "didn't you meet them when you picked up the package." 

"No, I was stopped before I could land, four fighters showed up and a transport shuttle with the package. They loaded it and left." Sable looked out her viewport at the chrome fighters still hovering around her location. "Well almost all of them. I have two fighter waiting for me to leave and about a dozen auto turrets trained on my location."

"That's odd," Leela murmured to herself, Sable quickly inquired, "I've checked the feeds for the holocast at any mention of a Merrick Arden, but there's nothing. whoever it is they are being extremely secretive."

“Things are getting weird around here, more than usual. You know some warships showed up the other day, big ones.” Sable explained. “Whoever they are they traipsing around in huge armor sets, some of them even took out a whole carpark, just destroyed the whole thing. I saw it on the holocast.”

“Oh—wow,” Leela leaned into the feed.

“They are everywhere. Showing up at all the bars, clubs—“

“In there suits?”

“Yeah! Some are all janked up somehow too, or they’re some alien race I don’t recognize and I’m being prejudice.” Sable relaxed into the conversation, especially after Leela chuckled. Sable watched as lights flickered against her face through the screen—she must have been watching the holocast.

“Oh my, they really did a number on that carpark—that’s a lot of blood. They went to bars with those suits on?”

“Yep,” Sable popped the word, “well, hopefully they will fend off these stupid pirates. They attacked a ship and then suicided into the planet. It’s got everyone on edge.”

“I hope so,” Leela paused, but didn’t look back up to the screen. Her thought passive and genuine. “I do worry about you Sable, I only have 187 days left in my apprenticeship and I hope I don’t get transferred to another courier because you—well, you know—died.”

Sable took a breath, the words sinking into her. It was uncomfortable. She didn’t like having someone waiting on her, especially not worrying about her. Maybe Leela wasn’t a leash. *Man, I’m such an asshole.*

"Hey Leela," Sables tone grew soft, "I'm sorry about earlier. I know you must have told me whatever was going on in your life at some point, I just didn't take the time to listen, or even care and... well I'm sorry about that." 

> Does Leela accept her apology?  `iv-oracle:50/50|18|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty`

Leela met Sable's gazed with pouty sort of thinking face. "My girlfriend left me last week. Took the apartment"

"That—that sucks," Sable was in uncharted space with this, "I uh, well you could always live in my apartment. It's empty now and I don't think I'm coming back."

"Oh, well, that would be—nice actually, I'm couch surfing right now. Thank Sable." Leela seemed genuine.

The awkward nods continued for a minute before Leela promptly cut the feed after Sable declared the e-drive was charged and ready to go. The chrome fighters watched her every second of the way as she turned to make headway towards her destination.

She has nodded off in her chair on the flight deck. It was known to happen, the subtle light shifting over head as she cruised FTL speed. The gentle hum of the engines reverberating through the hull lulling her to sleep. The rude awakening came in the form of a forceful slam of her face into her console.

"Where am I?" The male voice woke her mind and sent her into a panicked frenzy as she was pulled out of her chair by her hair.

Sable shrieked and grabbed at his are as she hit the cold metal plates on the floor. Her mind was racing with incoherent thoughts as her heart raged against it's ribbed cage, fear turned her veins cold as she tried to parse out what was happening.

"I don't know—" she cried out as he slammed her head against the wall.

"Like fuck you don't know, you're the one driving this thing." He twisted her head to face him. Her hair a sweaty mess sticking to her face with fearful tears and runny snot. 

"I don't know—I  don't know who you are." She managed to say between sobs.

"Shit," he muttered and let her go.

"Wait, wait, you—I do know, you're umm, from the club, last night," she began piecing together the events of last night. "you came back with me to my ship. I—I thought you left."

"Shit!" He screamed it this time. "I've missed roll call. You have to take me back."

"I—I can't, I have to get—" she stopped herself, "I have to get to my destination. I'll change the nav to drop by a station and drop you off, you can call someone, or I'll even pay for your transport back."
`iv-move:Compel|Heart|1|1|0|2|3|move:starforged/adventure/compel|burn=5:2` 

"Fine," his aggression seemed to dissipate, "I'll uh, take a shower then."

Sable wiped her nose and blood smeared on her courier suit. *Well, then, uhm—remember to disengage the fuel line, and check the fucking bathroom before you take off.*
