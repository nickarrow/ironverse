Where we left off...
Sable is a courier who has work her way in the ranks and was given the special task of expending the reach of the courier guild into an uncharted sector the Devil's Chain.
She has acquired her first notable job in the sector. Transporting a Black service shipment that marked Red, which means rush as fast as possible.
With this new resolves Sable has reaffirmed her mission to expand the Courier Guild's reach in the sector and live up to the legacy of her parents. I believe this calls Swear and Iron Vow and +1 Momentum for the start of the session.

```
Seeing as her first job started with her being unable to speak with the client a weak hit seems fitting. Something about the Courier Guild is they are neutral, their loyalty is to only the cargo they carry. When setting up new routes in uncharted sectors like this it's very crucial to prevent any one faction from monopolizing the courier's services. She will have to be careful going forward.

Let's begin
