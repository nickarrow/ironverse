# Flashback - Entering the Courier Guild
"Alright, Courier Route 497, welcome aboard Sable." The women, Kaska, handed Sable her courier signet, a small set of rectangle black iron pieces with four triangles pointed inward. The the back displayed her name, callsign, and courier number... 497. "Weasel?"

Sable instantly burst a breathy chuckle, "My parents gave me that callsign. I had a habit of getting into trouble as a child--as well as the habit of never telling the truth." Sable looked up at the women to meat her concerned gaze, "Don't worry, I've since grown out of the habit."

Another lie. Sable never really knew when telling the truth about anything when the best course of action. Her webs often grew larger than manageable, but she was long gone by the time the trails of her deceit came nipping at her heels.

Each glimmering node was a courier making their way through galaxy taking all manner of cargo from one place to another. Clusters of moving stars moving steadily, almost like the map was breathing. Her eyes traced the lines until they were scarce, then none existent. The [[Devil's Chain]] poised on the far edge of the map. She already had the request form filled out on her datapad. 

The last known place her parent's [[Find Her Parents Ship|ship]] was located.

The incessant light lit up the surrounding control in a soft red haze as it dimmed and brightened to the tone that rung through the cabin. Sable held her head and and walked through the corridors with one hand fisting a sleepy eye will the other eye saw stars and she blinked it awake. She slamed the toggle an
