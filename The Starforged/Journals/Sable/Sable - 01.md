# Flashback - Entering the Courier Guild
"Alright, Courier Route 497, welcome aboard Sable." The women, Kaska, handed Sable her courier signet, a small set of rectangle black iron pieces with four triangles pointed inward. The the back displayed her name, callsign, and courier number... 497. "Weasel?"

Sable instantly burst a breathy chuckle, "My parents gave me that callsign. I had a habit of getting into trouble as a child--as well as the habit of never telling the truth." Sable looked up at the women to meat her concerned gaze, "Don't worry, I've since grown out of the habit."

Another lie. Sable never really knew when telling the truth about anything when the best course of action. Her webs often grew larger than manageable, but she was long gone by the time the trails of her deceit came nipping at her heels.

"Uncoursed sectors can be really dangerous and very unstable. I know you're eager to prove yourself, being a legacy and all, but it's best to pace yourself. That's why your first job is an easy one in this sector before we send you further." Kaska pressed a button on her datapad and Sable's smaller handheld one came to life with the information.

A simple job. Something you could hand to a child. This was how it would start for Sable. One incremental step after another, slowly making her way to higher level jobs until they assigned her to her own sector. Probably something far out of the way, a lawless frontier.

Sables eyes glanced up to the galaxy map wavering in the holo-projector beaming overhead in the facility. Each glimmering node was a courier making their way through galaxy taking all manner of cargo from one place to another. Clusters of moving stars moving steadily, almost like the map was breathing. Her eyes traced the lines until they were scarce, then none existent. The [[Devil's Chain]] poised on the far edge of the map. She already had the request form filled out on her datapad. 

The last known place her parent's [[Find Her Parents Ship|ship]] was located.

# Courier of the [[Devil's Chain]]
*beep... beep... beep...* 

The incessant light lit up the surrounding control in a soft red haze as it dimmed and brightened to the tone that rung through the cabin. Sable held her head and and walked through the corridors with one hand fisting a sleepy eye will the other eye saw stars and she blinked it awake. She slammed the toggle and Leela's face came beaming across the screen.

"Good morning sleepy head, you have a package." Sable winced as the young girls voice came through the screen.

Leela was the unfortunate intern assigned to Sable's sector as her handler. Sable had been more than unkind to her in the past. She didn't like the idea of having them assign her babysitter. she made it just fine everywhere else, there was no need to keep her on a leash now that she finally got assigned the position she wanted in the Devil's Chain.

"How's the boyfriend Leela?" Perhaps Sable would make nice. Besides she needed a few minutes to get the ship warmed up.

`iv-oracle:Unlikely|84|No|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.unlikely` Leela whipped up her gaze and glared into the screen. Sable averted her gaze and her lips went into a flat line. Sable was missing something--or probably more likely completely forgot something.
