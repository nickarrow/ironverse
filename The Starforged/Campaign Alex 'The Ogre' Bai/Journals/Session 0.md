This is the beginning of a great adventure...


`iv-oracle:Begin a Session|88|Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/session/begin_a_session.begin_a_session` 

Sitting in his ship staring out at the larger ship ahead of him, he wonder's what he's gotten himself into this time.  That is a big ship. Probably with a lot of fire power. 

`iv-oracle:Starship Type|190|Fleet|oracle_rollable:starsmith/starship/type`   `iv-oracle:Fleet|20|Pirate wing|oracle_rollable:starforged/starship/fleet`  `iv-oracle:First Look|46|Modern or advanced design|oracle_rollable:starforged/starship/first_look` 

As he's looking Alex sees another ship come into view.

```
"Great. It's a whole fleet"
```

This job was getting big, too big. He'd have to ask for more money. 

```
Q- But look at those ships! So shinny and new. 
A- Shut it
```
The voice had become a fixture of his life. He still hated it. It was the reason he was out here. The reason he gave his skills to the highest bidder.

Five years earlier
```
Doctor - You need to leave boy, get out of here before they make you leave. 
```

They were abord the Ironhome that Alex had lived on, served on his whole life. He was a soldier. Protected the once who lived on this ship. But these people were not trusting, and they were very superstitious.  The spot on his hand had grown. Over the last year it had grown over his hand and now up his arm. And then there was the sleepwalking.  Things happened, He didn't do them, at least he didn't remember doing them. But these people. Possessed they said. Fools, it was just a rash. 

```
Doctor - Are you listening to me boy?

A- I'm listening. After all I've done here, this is where it goes?
```

There came a banging on the bulkhead door. 

```
Guard - Ogre, we know you're in there. Come out and talk to use. It's time we end this. 
A- By the Iron what is going on! I've spent my life keep you all safe and now you want me out! Where am I supposed to go?

Guard - We don't want to do this this way Ogre. 
```

Standing at the door Alex looks around. No other way out of this room. Last year he never would have found himself in this position. 

The next thing he knew he was in cuffs and being perp walked down the hallway. 

```
Guard - Listen Ogre, They know you were just doing what you thought was right. But they can't let that thing get loose in the home. You understand right. 

A- Thing? There's nothing wrong. Whatever... It's done. 

Guard - I guess it is. 
```

Now that rash had done just what the [[Doctor]] said. It had grown up his arm and into his head. And soon... sooner than he would probably like, it's was going to kill him. If these pirates didn't first. 

Klaxon's start blaring, red lights all over the ship. They spotted him 

```
Q- I thought we were going in all stealthy like?
A- Shut up
```
