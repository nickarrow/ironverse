Dad,

I don't have time to tell you the full story, but I just wanted to send a message home to let you know I'm safe.  You were right all along - there *are* two kinds of people, sheep and wolves, just like you said.  I thought maybe there was more to life than that, but as soon as I tried to find it everything went wrong.  I know where my place is now, and I'll be coming home soon.  But I won't be brought back by the people you sent to rescue me like a helpless victim - I'm coming home under my own power, in my own ship.  Things are complicated here and I need a bit more time, but I am going to make it happen.  I'll let you know everything when I get back.  Gotta go.

Sofia
