RECORDING STARTING... NOW
VIDEO FILE NAME: E. STIRLING REPORT, N 12A
___ 

*This is Echo Stirling, freelancer for the Protected Library, badge number JQNQF52GO1.*

*I'm reporting in from outside the Precursor Vault "Mausefort", orbiting Croifols-4: My self-appointed vault exploration took... two days, three hours and twenty-four minutes, as recorded by the Ilex-zed sensors, though to me it felt much shorter. At the end of the expedition I recovered an unknown relic.* 

*The rest of the Vault lies unexplored and looks to be much larger inside than outside: I will send the recording my suit made as I was inside with this verbal report and I recommend that, should the Library want to send anyone, they send someone with expertise with remnants and spirits, as the Eccentric Energies register high in the activity scale around here.*

*The relic has caused an altered-perception incident as I took it, and has since confirmed its status as "awake" and "watching", and seems to be connected to the intentions of those who try to wield it. Even having since then disappeared, it continues to confirm its presence at the edge of my consciousness.*

*I request access to the Protected Library to both report my findings in-depth and study other similar experiences, to find any commonalities. I will not, however, reveal the Relic's name but in person, as it's being actively hunted.*

NEW ENCRYPTED VIDEO FILE ATTACHED: Be cautious
___ 

*On a less formal note... I explored this vault because a spirit from my Ironhome tasked me with it, but the Library is sure to be interested in my findings. The spirit said that there was a connection to the attack on Ackriss-2, and since then I had the time to search for information: seeing the reports that are coming out of there, and the rumors about the Ascendancy of Awakened Worlds that I'm hearing... I think this might be serious. Especially because this relic I have it's apparently also connected to a splinter group of the Risen Union, and that bothers me: they're friendly, but so mysterious...*

*I'm coming there as quickly as I can. Find me all the information the Library has on them, and on this kind of relic, won't you?*
