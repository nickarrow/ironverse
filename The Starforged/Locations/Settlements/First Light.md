The First Light is the erstwhile home of [[Echo 'Phantom' Stirling]]. The settlement is built in a ironhome as keeps a slow but constant movement throughout the sector, keeping away from well-travelled routes and planets.
They appear peaceful, but the society is very structured, almost caste-like if informally. They have enormous vaults where they keep their dead preserved, they always have, and some of those corpses even belong to people who were there when the Exodus began. They revere their dead, especially because among them a 'gift' has manifested, some people can talk with the dead: it may be because those unliving in the vaults sometimes wake up.
They do value historical memory a lot and try and talk to their older dead regularly, but they also try and live as long as they can in as an untouched state as they may (they don't really like prosthetics etc, they are abilist as a society tbh), so they developed as cloning tech to create themselves new bodies to transfer their consciousness into. Sometimes, though, those clones gain unexpected sentience.
