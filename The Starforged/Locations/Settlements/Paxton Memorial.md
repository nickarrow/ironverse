Paxton Memorial is a large, wheel-like station in the orbit of [[Erra]].  There are eight habitation modules, each at the end of a spoke coming out from the central hub where the command module is.  The main industry is salvage - derelict, wrecked, or abandoned ships are towed here and the crews of workers strip them and break them down.  Anything that can't be used or sold is simply flung down to the uninhabited planet below, usually burning up in the atmosphere but occasionally crashing into the surface of the toxic planet.
