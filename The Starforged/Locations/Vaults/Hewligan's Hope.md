Hewligan's Hope is a large cone with a dome at the wide end.  Its features appear to depict a face, but not a human one.  The narrow end flashes every few seconds.  It appears to be made of a dark red, plant-like material.

[[Sagan]] is a nearby settlement, its residents worship the vault because they feel a sense of inner spiritual peace when they are in its vicinity.

Its interior is unexplored.
