After sending the [[Message 05 - Echo 'Phantom' Stirling|report]] to the Library, Echo felt that she had definitely earned a shower and a bit of rest, and went to clean off the bone dust that still felt attached to her skin as if with glue. 
Feeling much lighter and calmer, after, she switched on the small on-board food facilities and helped herself to a warm tea, apparently spiced with a herb mixture coming from plants that their ancestors had brought back in their aquaponics from their galaxy of origin. `iv-move:Hearten|Heart|1|2|0|2|5|move:starforged/recover/hearten|burn=6:2` 

Echo smiled as she sipped it, remembering quite well when one of said old-galaxy ancestors had woken up and made a ruckus due to the exact tea she was drinking: someone enterprising had changed the recipe enough that the spirit, Serrah Anova, had staged protests and lively (well, undead-ly) debates all over the ironhome, unsettling most of the inhabitants even as their alive descendants had been arguing right back about changes in the marketability of some flavour profiles over the millennia. 
In the end the spirits awoken had been many, five new variations of the recipe had been created, and a few of the already rare Necromancers, Echo included, had been called to settle the spirits after.
It had been one of the first jobs she'd done for her Ironhome after fleeing it, and all-in-all it had been surprisingly fun.

She hummed and sent a text message to Vesper on the wave of that nostalgia, giving him a brief update about the Hourglass situation, as Roman had gone back to being completely dead after their brief information-giving interlude, trusting his descendant to handle the Hourglass.

She then melted back, relaxed for the moment, right in the tiny makeshift kitchen, reclined in the squished chaise-longue (bolted to the floor) that often replaced her bed, eating area, research space... and anything else. Her eyes slipped closed before she could even notice her tiredness catching up to her.

Her comm beeping woke her with a start. She almost got drenched with the now-cold tea that had miraculously remained in her hand the whole time, but she managed to keep it balanced as she blearily looked first at the scanner, checking for any changes around the Ilex-zed, and then to the messages.

`iv-ooc:does Echo already know Santos?`  `iv-oracle:Likely|74|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.likely`  `iv-ooc:I'm thinking they're basically first contact for the freelancers. What's their relationship like?`  `iv-oracle:Initial Disposition|178|Commanding|oracle_rollable:starsmith/character/initial_disposition`  `iv-ooc:why thank you, who would have guessed. Let's add to it`  `iv-oracle:Initial Disposition|117|Tit for tat|oracle_rollable:starsmith/character/initial_disposition`   `iv-ooc:Pronouns? 1-2: he/him, 3-4 they/them, 5-6 she/her, 7-8 variations (eg: he/they)`  `iv-dice:1d8|1`  

Echo sighed at her contact's name and downed the rest of her cold tea with a grimace, then went to te cockpit and plugged the coordinates in the Ilex-zed interface, leaving the ship's computer to search for any known passages to Celadon-2 from here even as she thought about something to bargain with the man: Aparna was a good man of course, but always managed to plug his own self-interest in his dealings.

`iv-ooc:Is there a known passage in the Ilex-zed navcomputer?`  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|2|3|0|6|9|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information` 
`iv-ooc:Now, I would roll Pay the Price here, but honestly this was a little low stakes as it was, I only did it this way because travel around the forge is fairly difficult, even with coordinates... so I'm ruling that I'll have Echo do an expedition to get there, instead of setting a course. It's still going to be fairly easy.`
