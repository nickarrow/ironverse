# [[Barille 03 - Searching Through Reck]]

```
BARILLE
Okay Barille, let's take stock. Some sort of other-world, mind-warping, portal is opening. And allowing traversal by... whatever that was. Reck is a cluster on a good day, and this isn't a good day. The Ascendency's attack is causing extra chaos, and there are still other players here. 

Let's assume Karthick was taken, or joined up with these... entities. Is this something that the upper class religion is based on, or just a coincidence?

What's the play Barille... think... 
```

Barille sighs a long deep sigh, and then looks towards the direction the human-entity thing went. 

```
BARILLE
Yeah, let's go ahead and follow whatever that thing was. 
```

`iv-ooc:Going to try and use undetake an expedition to chase this thing through the settlement. ` Barille sets off to  `iv-track-create:Track the other-world entity to its source|The Starforged/Campaign Barille Black/Progress/Barille/Track the other-world entity to its source.md`  `iv-move:Undertake an Expedition|Shadow|5|1|0|9|5|move:starforged/exploration/undertake_an_expedition`  `iv-track-advance:Track the other-world entity to its source|The Starforged/Campaign Barille Black/Progress/Barille/Track the other-world entity to its source.md|0|8|dangerous|1` 

Barille moves quickly and quietly down the corridor. He's following the isotope readings on his hand terminal and comes to what was once some sort of  `iv-oracle:Area|47|Market or trade|oracle_rollable:starforged/derelict/community/area`  `iv-oracle:Feature|80|Panoramic viewport|oracle_rollable:starforged/derelict/community/feature`  `iv-oracle:Peril|85|Heartbreaking memento of lost lives|oracle_rollable:starforged/derelict/community/peril` 

The scene Barille comes across is the one he was dreading. It appears to be where the Ascendency frigate made impact with the settlement. Reck itself is built into a canyon wall, and uses much of the surrounding rock, but this was a perimeter part of the settlement. The orbital velocity of the ship seems to have punched right through and the destruction is significant.   `iv-meter:Spirit|5|3`  `iv-move:Endure Stress|Spirit|2|3|0|1|10|move:starforged/suffer/endure_stress` 

Barille was hoping to avoid this part, but now he was faced with it. A lot of people lost their lives here, and crews were still actively working to put out fires and. 

> Barille looks at his hand terminal, and then back at the crews. He can't not help here. 
`iv-move:Explore a Waypoint|Wits|5|2|0|10|7|move:starforged/exploration/explore_a_waypoint`  `iv-noroll:Pay the Price|move:starforged/fate/pay_the_price`  `iv-meter:Spirit|3|2`  `iv-move:Endure Stress|Spirit|2|2|0|8|3|move:starforged/suffer/endure_stress`  `iv-meter:Spirit|2|3` 

Barille's guilt hits him hard as he rushes forward. He grabs a mask, and then a medical pack from the wall, and runs towards the chaos to try and help whoever he can. *Yeah, just have a beer at the bar. You coward. Someone else's problem... sure. He thinks to himself.* 

Rushing into crash site, he's going to save whoever he can.  `iv-move:Face Danger|Heart|4|3|0|5|7|move:starforged/adventure/face_danger` Barille finds  `iv-oracle:Number|70|Many|oracle_rollable:sundered_isles/misc/magnitude/number` people trapped. A massive wall of rock and flex-steel came crashing down, and he works to get them free for almost an hour, digging and prying out rubble. Finally, the hole is large enough, and the people are able to pass through. He helps the last of them through, and then falls to his knees, exhausted.  `iv-meter:Health|5|4`  `iv-move:Endure Harm|Health|1|4|0|7|9|move:starforged/suffer/endure_harm`  `iv-meter:Health|4|3` 

One of the survivors puts a hand on his shoulder.  `iv-oracle:Given Name|94|Vuldar|oracle_rollable:starsmith/character/name/given_name`  `iv-oracle:Family Name|246|Hollodo|oracle_rollable:starsmith/character/name/family_name` 

```
VULDAR HOLLODO
Hey, thank you. Name's Hollodo, and I am not sure we would have survived if you hadn't helped dig us out. 

BARILLE BLACK
Yeah, don't mention it. Are there others?

VULDAR HOLLODO
We got everyone out that I know about. What the hell happened? Do you know?

BARILLE BLACK
It was an attack, a sucicide run at orbital velocity. I have no idea why they targeted you, nor what would push them to suicide. 

VULDAR HOLLODO
Gods. Who'd want to attack Reck!? You look pretty banged up, we're heading to the medical ward. Come on. 

BARILLE BLACK
Sorry, *coughs* I got a hot date. Watch your back Hollodo. 

VULDAR HOLLODO
Suit yourself kid. See you round. 
```

> Barille staggers back to the less rubble strewn corridor and lays flat on his back. He check's his hand terminal, and gets an isotope ping.

Barille collects himself, then stands back up and heads off.  `iv-move:Undertake an Expedition|Wits|1|2|0|10|4|move:starforged/exploration/undertake_an_expedition`
