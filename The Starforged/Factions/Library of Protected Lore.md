The Library of Protected Lore is an organization dedicated to understanding, protecting and researching the history of the Forge and what information is available about the galaxy left behind before the Cataclysm.
They are a known name, but not really famous or remarkable in any way - some enterprising (or paranoid) folk assume that this has been done on purpose and presume a shadowy motive behind it, some just presume that this is done so no Clan or other faction can find them easily and destroy or plunder their archives, since it's known that they are indeed interested in black iron and precursor artifacts. In truth, the origin of the faction is nebulous to those that aren't part of its upper management, and any hidden motivation, if it even exists, doesn't reach the ear of the researchers, retrievers or reviewers simply there working for a love of history or science.

Where both factions are present in the same sector, the Library has a business and sometimes favours-based relationship with the [[Courier Guild]]: their agents often employ them to transport Cargo from freshly explored vaults, derelicts, ruins or planets, though not the more dangerous or sensitive relics, materials or ancient texts.
