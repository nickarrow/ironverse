(WIP)
In every epoch of humanity, the rich have always needed enforcers.

But perhaps their fixation with honour is rooted in compensation more than pride? For in the most secret records accessible only to the Warlord and select Clan-Heads, there lies a story.

When the Exodus commenced, and the Ironhomes of the Founders fled into the dark, the one who would rule all the Milky Way took umbrage. Though the Tyrant was willing to burn the galaxy to ash if that is what it took to be its master, their hubris was so rancid that they would not tolerate any who would choose life over death or submission.

When their dominion over the Milky Way was complete, when the Tyrant’s rampaging armies had no more frontiers to pillage and grew restless, they opted to kill two birds with one stone. Bleeding whole sectors into crushing poverty to cover the cost, a grand armada was constructed, and all but the most loyal armies were herded aboard to punish those who had just wanted to live.

The survivors among the betrayed, who fled bleeding into unknown stars before fracturing into a thousand and one pieces, became the Firestorm Clans.

The betrayers, for they merely moved from serving one sadistic tyrant to a council of lesser selfish ones, joined together to form Household Serrato.
