Tybalt-Yhen,

I'm writing this message today, I'm leaving Port Koshiba tomorrow, and the Couriers Guild will deliver it the day after.  I'll be long gone by the time you read this, so there's no use trying to find me.  Apologies for the secrecy, I'm sure you'll understand why it's necessary as I explain what I know about the Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds.

I'm a detective, of sorts.  I was recently kidnapped by pirates, and forced to work a missing persons case for them.  On our way back to the pirate base, we came across an Ascendancy frigate.  It was some kind of listening post.  They attacked immediately, but we managed to fight them off them and flee.

After returning the missing person to the pirate base, the pirates sent me, along with a small fleet of pirate attack ships, back to the scene of the battle to look for clues, but the frigate was nowhere to be seen.

After a second battle with Ascendancy reinforcements, we investigated the debris field from the original battle.  We found some important information - the Ascendancy are after an ancient artifact that the pirates had in their possession (it's now with me), and were planning to attack the pirate base to get it.  I later found out that the artifact has some kind of magical power that lets its bearer speak to the dead.

Anyway, the reason I'm writing to you is to warn you.  As we were investigating the debris, another Ascendancy fleet warped in.  I want you to know that they have at least one dreadnought under their command.  We escaped before it could get in range of us, but it was big and it was armed to the teeth.

I'm writing this message because we both seem to be aligned against the Ascendancy, and the more damage you do to them the more it helps me, so I want you to be ready for anything they throw at you.

I'm not sure how you view pirates and people who work with them, even at proverbial gunpoint, so I'm choosing to hide my identity.  Besides, I don't want to give up the location of the pirate base - client confidentiality and all that.

I have attached images of the listening post and the dreadnought, as well as the coordinates of the battlefield, in case you wanted to send someone to check the debris field for yourselves - we may have missed something because our search was cut short by the Ascendancy dreadnought bearing down on us.

A friend.

PROGRESS: YES
