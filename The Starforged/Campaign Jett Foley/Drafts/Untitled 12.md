"And there we go, we are out of FTL and officially in the Devil's Chain sector."

There were four of them; the pilot, the gunner, the brawler, the leader.

"So we just keep jumping from place to place and eventually fate will intervene and we'll see our target?"

"Yep."

"How will we know it's the right person?"

"We'll just know.  Trust the process."

Jett heads back to Port Koshiba.  He is delayed by a plasma storm, but no damage is done to the ship.

Once he arrives and gets back into town, he hires the Couriers Guild to take the medical supplies to The Snakepit.  He doesn't have time to do the four-week round trip just to drop off a box.  He's not sure if the Guild usually delivers to top-secret pirate dens, but he figures it will be okay just this once.

Then he tries to find someone who's hiring.

He finds out the hard way that looking for work by word of mouth is considered illegal in Port Koshiba - income tax is taken very seriously there and the kind of easy, cash-in-hand arrangements that Jett was looking for are strictly forbidden.  After one quite educational night in the cells, Jett is back on the streets.

The only person Jett knows in Port Koshiba is the guy from the Cartographer's Guild, so he heads there.  He enters the room, and sees the man in the same tired stance looking at the same old datapad.  "Peter!" Jett calls out.

"It's Lucas, actually" says Lucas.

"Right, right, sorry about that.  If I were looking for juicy navigational data to sell to you, legally and paying all appropriate taxes of course, where would be a good place to start looking right now?"

Lucas looks at his screen for a moment and taps on his keyboard.

"There's a new settlement named Burrow on the planet of Dusk.  If you can map a route there, you'll get a decent amount for the data."

Jett takes out his black iron ring and holds it between his fingers.  "I vow, on this black iron ring-"

"That really isn't necessary."

"-that I, Jett Foley, will deliver to you, Lucas of the Cartographers Guild, the navigational data between Port Koshiba and Burrow."

"Ok, that's great.  I'll stay here and read my datapad while you do that."
