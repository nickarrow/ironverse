"You, know, I feel bad for leaving Bri behind like that.  She'll die slow.  It would have been kinder just to shoot her in the back." 

"We saw an opportunity and we took it.  You'll forget all about it when we sell this thing."

"Is it really an AI core?  What if it's not even working? It's so small. "

"That's the point, dummy.  It's gotta be some kind of advanced prototype.  It'll be worth a lot to the right people.  Maybe we can even retire off of this score."

"Just as long as you don't abandon *me* so you can take my cut."

"I've done some things I'm not proud of to get here, sure, but I'm not going to backstab my own twin brother."

"Hey, the controls have stopped responding."

"Same here.  It's like something's taken over the ship."

"Life support has been switched off.  What the hell is going on?"

"Oh god, the cabins are being vented, all the air is being sucked out of the ship.  What do we do?"

Neither man notices the small blinking light on the experimental AI core in their last, desperate moments.

Jett and Bri arrive at Audun and dock at Port Koshiba.  "I've never been on a planet before" says Bri.  "That must be what a sky looks like."  She pauses for a moment, taking in the sight.  "It's huge.  I can barely comprehend how much air there is here.  Do they need massive air cycling plants to keep it all breathable?"

"Actually the air on Koshiba is rather thin, I'd recommend getting inside the city as soon as you can.  And yeah, the city itself has air recyclers but the planet refreshes the air naturally - plants keep the air breathable." says Jett.

"Plants?  That's so weird.  It's so hot here - don't they have air conditioning?"

"That's called 'nature', Bri.  No air conditioning, I'm afraid.  The weather just does what it wants.  On Audun, it's always hot.  Too hot for anything to grow here, that's why the people have to live in a bubble.  Come on, let's get to the city.  I've never ridden on a train before."

"We're going to ride on a train?  I've seen those before on holo-shows."

---

They ride the train into town.  Bri is amazed by the size of the aquifiers they speed past, she's used to air and water being worth more than diamonds or gold so seeing so much of it just lying there unguarded is like something out of a dream.

Eventually, they reach the outskirts of the city and disembark.

"So...you're going to find a ship and join the crew as an engineer?" asks Jett.

"Yeah, I guess I don't have any other choice." replies Bri.

"You could always come with me, you know.  I can't pay you or anything, but- ""

Bri cuts him off.  "Sorry, Jett.  I appreciate you helping me out back on the scav ship, and I appreciate the ride back to port, but I have my own plans.  I want a ship of my own again, and I'm not going to get one just bumming around the galaxy."

"Okay, sure.  Well, I guess this is goodbye then.  Good luck out there, Bri."

"You too.  I owe you one if we ever cross paths again.  I hope you find your destiny."

Jett asks around for directions, and eventually makes his way to the Cartographer's Guild.  He enters their offices and at the reception desk he sees...

`iv-oracle:Given Name|63|Lucas|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/name/given_name`  `iv-oracle:Family Name|84|Dykstra|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/name/family_name`  `iv-oracle:First Look|46|Haggard|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/first_look`  `iv-oracle:Initial Disposition|6|Helpful|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/initial_disposition` 

...a man who appears to be half-asleep, looking at a datapad.  The man sees Jett and puts the datapad away, and stands up straight.

"Hello there sir, I'm Lucas.  How can I help you today?" says the man.

"I'm looking to trade navigational data.  I'm looking for a certain planet, I have data from across Devil's Chain."

"Let me just check our files.  What was the name of the planet?"

"Pyla."

"Ok, let me see here..."  The man types away on a keyboard for a few minutes. "Yes, Pyla, here it is.  What exactly do you have to trade?"

`iv-move:Compel|Heart|1|2|0|2|4|move:starforged/adventure/compel` 

Jett shows him his nav data.

"Ah, I see.  Well for that, I can give you the coordinates for Pyla but not the course information."

"What would I have to do to get the course information?"

"Bring in more nav data to trade.  Between you and me, by the time you've gathered enough data you could probably find Pyla by yourself with the coordinates."

"Okay then, I'll take the coordinates." says Jett.

"Excellent" says Lucas.  "I'll make the transfer now."

Jett feels exhausted after his recent adventures, and the expedition to Pyla is going to be fraught with peril.  He decides to spend a few days in Port Koshiba relaxing and trying to resupply the ship.

`iv-move:Sojourn|Heart|3|2|0|6|3|move:starforged/recover/sojourn`  `iv-meter:Spirit|2|4` 

Jett heads to the market, but is unable to get the supplies he needs for his ship - apparently there are two House Serrato ships docked in town and prices are sky high as the merchants adjust their prices for their presumably wealthy guests.

Jett goes to a bar and gets talking to the locals.  Everybody is talking about the House Serrato ships.  They are looking for information on the Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds.  Jett sees Tybalt-Yhen's proclamation, as well as the footage of the parking lot brawl.  He toys with the idea of going to the Serratos with what he knows about the Ascendancy, but in the end decides against it - his connections to the Void Cobras are bound to get him in trouble if he does, and there's no mention of a reward - only a pledge to return what was stolen.  The only thing that Jett lost to the Ascendancy was Failsafe, and not even the Serratos could bring him back.  He spends the evening drinking with the locals, swapping stories and sharing gossip and rumors. He leaves the bar feeling ready for the road ahead.

Awaking in the morning, Jett decides to start looking for Pyla right away.  He preps his ship, and takes off.
