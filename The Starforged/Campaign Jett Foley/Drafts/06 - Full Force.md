The Snakepit was abuzz with activity.  Everyone was preparing for the evacuation.  Jett had made a desperate dash for *The Irony* and he and the pirate fleet had managed to jump away before the fleet of Ascendancy ships with its colossal flagship had managed to get in weapons range.  As soon as he saw the evidence Jett had gathered, Machete had ordered The Snakepit to be evacuated.

>Is The Snakepit capable of FTL flight?  `iv-oracle:50/50|11|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 

The station's e-drive, itself scavenged from a derelict dreadnought, was being powered up and the pirates planned to jump as soon as they were able.

"What about this relic they mentioned?  It's the reason they're going to attack you." Jett asks Machete.

>Does Machete know what the relic is?  `iv-oracle:50/50|57|No|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 

"No idea.  We have all kinds of weird and wonderful junk that our raiders brought back and we couldn't find a buyer for.  Go talk to the quartermaster, I'll tell her to let you take a look."

Jackal is a middle-aged, tough-looking woman with a utility bot buzzing around her.  Her hair is wild and unkempt and she looks a little bewildered.  "You Jett?  Machete called me."

"Yeah, that's me.  I'm looking for something, but I don't know what it is.  He said you have a collection of oddities I can take a look at?"

"Oddities, junk, same difference.  We have a bunch of stuff we should have voided a long time ago.  It's in the vault."

"Why keep it in a vault if it's junk?"

"Some of the junk is magical.  The vault keeps the energy trapped inside.  Made from a special material."

Jett, unsure whether she's serious or joking, follows Jackal to the vault.  Jackal lets him inside.  The vault is a large room filled with various items of various sizes.  A lot of the items are works of art - the Cobras clearly don't have an art fence; some of the pieces here look like they're worth a fair bit.

"Weird stuff's over in that corner" says Jackal.  "The bot's gonna follow you and make a note if you take anything."

"It's okay to take stuff from the vault?"

"It's okay to take junk from the junk corner.  Take anything else and you'll lose a hand."  Jackal walks off, and her utility bot floats over to Jett, watching him.  Jett starts looking through the junk corner.

Jett is immediately drawn to one of the objects on the shelf.  It's a four-sided pyramid with a flat base, approximately fist-sized, giving off a strong aura.  It's made of a marble-white metal and tendrils of dark energy are rising up from the artifact.  Jett reaches out and touches it.

>Is there a reaction when Jett touches the pyramid?  `iv-oracle:50/50|88|No|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` 

It's cold to the touch.  Jett picks it up.  It's light, but it makes Jett feel the same way he did when he was holding the gun.  Stronger, more confident, more powerful.

"I'm taking this" he says to the bot.

"Item designation 'Stupid-looking pyramid piece of crap' removed from inventory by 'Jett Foley'." the bot says in a monotone, robotic voice.

Two weeks later, The Snakepit has jumped halfway across the sector with no sign of pursuit.  Machete decides they've run far enough and it's time to start raiding again - supplies are getting low.  He sends out scouts to find out about nearby shipping lanes and lightly-guarded settlements.

Jett spends the trip thinking about the pyramid.  He tracks down the pirate who originally found it; it had been in a  `iv-oracle:Expanse|59|Debris field: Mineral asteroids|oracle_rollable:starforged/space/sighting/expanse` debris field somewhere in the Devil's Chain.  The debris field had originally been a moon, but something had destroyed it millennia ago.  The pyramid was floating in the wreckage.  Jett asked for the details of the planet the moon was in orbit around.

`iv-oracle:Planetary Class|3|Desert World|oracle_rollable:starforged/planet/class`  `iv-oracle:Sample Names|13|Pyla|oracle_rollable:starforged/planet/desert/name`  `iv-oracle:Observed From Space|79|Vibrant terrain colors|oracle_rollable:starforged/planet/desert/observed_from_space` 

The pirate told him the planet's name was [[Pyla]], but was unable to give him a location - The Snakepit's move had meant everybody's old navigation data was useless; they were going to have to start exploring again from scratch.

---

Jett discusses how to proceed with Eris.  He has to go to Pyla to investigate the pyramid's origins, that much is clear, but he also has his vow to provide medical supplies to The Snakepit to consider.  Jett eventually decides to deal with the medical supplies first - he has no idea how long his trip to Pyla will take or if he'd be able to find the supplies during it, so he'll get the supplies nearby before setting off.

Jett leaves The Snakepit and plots a random course.

"Jett, we have a problem" says Eris.

"What's wrong?" replies Jett.

"There's an anomaly out here.  It's sending out strong gravity waves every few hours."

"Can the shields withstand the force?"

"We don't have shields, you haven't installed a shield module."

"Oh.  We're in trouble, then."

"Not necessarily" replies Eris.  "If we reconfigure the laser cannons to fire on a dissonant frequency to the wavelength of the gravity wave, we could conceivably create a window in the wave just large enough for the ship to pass though."

"What?"

"We might be able to shoot a hole in the gravity wave."

"Oh.  What are our other options?"

"Get hit full-force by the gravity wave."

"Let's try the guns."

`iv-move:Face Danger|Wits|5|3|0|10|9|move:starforged/adventure/face_danger` 

The guns don't work.  The ship is hit full-force by the gravity wave.
