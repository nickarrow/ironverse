Serrato,

I'm contacting you discreetly because my 'captain' seems to think meddling in the affairs of the Ascendancy is a wise move.

I have attached battle data from two skirmishes with Ascendency ships, scrubbed of ship identifiers of course.  Their ships consistently outperform their projected capabilities in terms of speed, sensor range, weapon damage, and maneuverability.  However, they lack strategy and attack wildly and without coordination.

They seem to be conducting deep surveillance of their prospective targets - see attached image of a frigate with large sensor dishes attached around the midsection.  They were spying on a pirate base in preparation for an attack.

The main reason I'm contacting you is with a warning.  The Ascendency have a dreadnought of their own - see attached image and sensor details.  If they attack Port Koshiba while you are docked they will be able to bombard your ships freely from the air.  I would strongly recommend that you move to orbit around Audun and use transport shuttles to move to and from the surface so your ships can be battle-ready at all times, but of course that is your call.  I'm also sending you the last known location of the enemy dreadnought.
