Dear Reaver-Chief Tybalt, Son of Bertold, of the Clan Yhen of Household Serrato,

I'm contacting you discreetly because my 'captain' seems to think personally meddling in the affairs of the Ascendency is a wise move.

I have attached battle data from two skirmishes with Ascendency ships, scrubbed of friendly ship identifiers of course.  Ascendency ships consistently outperform their projected capabilities in terms of speed, sensor range, weapon damage, and maneuverability.  However, they lack strategy and attack wildly and without coordination.

They seem to be conducting sophisticated deep surveillance of their intended targets - see attached image of a frigate with large sensor dishes attached around the midsection.  It was spying on a settlement in preparation for an attack.

The main reason I'm contacting you is with a warning.  The Ascendency have a dreadnought of their own - see attached image and sensor details.  If they attack Port Koshiba while you are docked on the ground they will be able to bombard your ships freely from space and you will be unable to reply.  I would strongly recommend that you move your dreadnought from the surface into orbit around Audun and use transport shuttles to move to and from the surface so you can be battle-ready at all times, but of course that is your call.  I'm also sending you the last known location of the enemy dreadnought, although that information is almost a month old at the time of writing.

Someone's going to run into that thing at some point and frankly, rather you than me.

A friend.
