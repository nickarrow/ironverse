"Sir, one of the precognition machines has activated."

"Where?"

"Devil's Chain sector."

"I thought that site was abandoned?"

"It was.  The base is unmanned, but the equipment is still operational."

"Very well.  Prepare a strike team.  Have them find the agent and tail them at a distance.  They're to protect them at all costs, but only reveal themselves in truly dire situations."

"Understood.  It will take some time for the team to reach Devil's Chain, of course."

"Of course.  No time to waste, then."

"Do you really think you're going to find a ghost aboard the ship?" asks Bri.

"No, of course not.  But doing the investigation to get the navigation data is going to be quicker than trying to find Koshiba with blind luck." replies Jett.

The pair are aboard *The Irony*, waiting for nightfall when the ghost sightings usually happen.

"You know, you're the first person I've spoken to in almost a year?  Other than Ogre." says Bri.

"How did you end up stranded aboard a derelict, anyway?" asks Jett.

"Ugh, long story.  I'll tell you over a drink sometime.  The short version is that I guess my crew decided that splitting a score two ways was better than splitting it three ways so they stole my ship and left me behind."

"That's rough.  So are you going to try and track them down when you get to Koshiba?"

"I have nothing left.  I'm going to have to sign on with a ship and start from the bottom all over again.  Revenge is a luxury I can't afford."

A moment of silence passes between the two.

"Well, that's a problem for another day." says Bri. "We have a ghost to catch.  It'll be getting dark soon, we should go."

Jett and Bri walk up and down the main corridor where the mysterious sightings have been occurring.

At around midnight ship's time, there's a sudden chill in the air. 

`iv-oracle:Feature|3|Disembodied voices|oracle_rollable:starforged/location_theme/haunted/feature` 

Jett and Bri hear echoey, ethereal voices.

`iv-oracle:Descriptor|2|Abundant|oracle_rollable:starforged/core/descriptor`  `iv-oracle:Focus|94|Vault|oracle_rollable:starforged/core/focus` 

"Stay out of the vault", the voices keep repeating.  "Stay out of the vault, stay out of the vault."  Jett tries to follow the sound of the voices, but they're coming from every direction at once.  The voices quieten, and eventually dissipate.

"What the hell was that?" asked Bri.

"Well, at least we know it's not just spacer tales." says Jett.  "But it's not going to be enough to satisfy the captain.  Let's keep looking."

"That's it?  Just keep looking?  There's an actual ghost on this ship, Jett.  Ghosts exist.  They're real."

"I know.  Exciting, isn't it?"

About an hour later, Jett senses something moving in his pack.  He opens it to take a look and sees the pyramid.  "That's strange, I thought I locked it up on *The Irony*." he says.

"What is it?" asks Bri.

"It's a long story."

"Does it usually shake like that?"

"Never."

`iv-oracle:Opportunity|13|Encounter with a benign spirit or being|oracle_rollable:starforged/location_theme/haunted/opportunity` 

The pyramid stops shaking and emits a faint glow.

'...Hello?' comes a faint voice from behind Bri and Jett.  They turn around and see an older-looking woman with long black hair.  "Can you hear me?"

"We can hear you." says Jett. 

"That thing you're holding.  It's bright.  So bright.  Usually everything is so dark.  And nobody can hear me."

"Do you know what this is?" asks Jett, holding the pyramid up a little.

"It's powerful."

"So I see.  I don't really know how this works - is there something you want us to do?  Put you to rest somehow?"
