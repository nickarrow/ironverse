"You're just going to abandon the Snakepit?" says Jett.

"We know they're planning an attack, and they have a dreadnought" says Machete.  "We're pirates, not a navy - we're here to survive, not go down with the ship."

"But this is your home!"

"Kid, we've been here for all of two years.  We moved into a derelict that we found.  Now we're moving out, that's all."

"What will you do?"

"We'll stay on the move.  A pirate's loyalty is to the fleet, not the base."

"How will I find you again?  I promised to bring medical supplies, I can't just abandon my vow."

Machete looks at Jett for a moment.  "You're serious, aren't you?  Look, I absolve you of your vow.  I'll square things with the doc.  You aren't going to see us again, kid.  Staying hidden is how we survive."

Jett's shoulders slump.  "Fine.  But they're going to keep chasing you as long as you have this 'relic' they mentioned."

"If we have what they're looking for it's probably in storage with all the other weird junk we haven't been able to get rid of." says Machete.  "Go talk to the quartermaster, they might know more."
