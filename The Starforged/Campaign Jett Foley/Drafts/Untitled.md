CHAPTER 7

`iv-meter:Starship / Integrity|5|3`  `iv-move:Withstand Damage|Starship / Integrity|6|3|0|3|10|move:starforged/suffer/withstand_damage`  `iv-meter:Momentum|8|7`  `iv-meter:Starship / Integrity|3|4` 

The wave crashes into the ship, sending it spinning through space and causing structural damage.  Jett rights the ship and runs a systems check - no major damage, just a few minor issues.  "Will the e-drive be ready before the next wave hits?" he asks Eris.

"Yeah.  Let's get out of here."

They reach the next waypoint without issue.  Jett checks the scanners.

`iv-oracle:Expanse|63|Debris field: Frozen asteroids|oracle_rollable:starforged/space/sighting/expanse` 

"There's nothing of use here.  Let's wait for the e-drive and try again."

They make it to the next waypoint, but their arrival is delayed by a fault in the drive engine - the minor damage caused by the gravity wave necessitated some quick repairs in-flight.

`iv-oracle:Expanse|88|Dense nebula cloud|oracle_rollable:starforged/space/sighting/expanse` 

They are in the middle of a dense nebula cloud.  Their scanners are severely compromised, they can only see a short distance from the ship.  Nevertheless, the e-drive recharges without incident and they make another jump.

They come out of warp and immediately see an almost incomprehensible structure.  It's a large cone with a dome at the wide end.  Its features appear to depict a humanoid face, but not a human one.  The narrow end flashes every few seconds.  It appears to be made of a dark red, plant-like material.

"What do you make of that?" asks Jett.

"Weird.  It's gotta be a precursor vault of some kind but I've never heard of one like that." replies Eris.

"What do you think it's doing out here in deep space?"

The conversation is interrupted by an incoming hail.

"*Irony*, this is Sagan.  If you want to swing by for a bite to eat while your e-drive recharges you're more than welcome to dock.  Or are you here to join us?"

"Actually, we're on a bit of a mercy mission, trying to find some crucial supplies for a new settlement not far from here." Jett says, neglecting to mention the nature of the 'new settlement'.

"Well, come on by then, I sure hope you can find what you're looking for at our little outpost."
