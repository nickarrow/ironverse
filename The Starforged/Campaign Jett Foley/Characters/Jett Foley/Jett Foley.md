BACKSTORY

A long time ago, there was a group of people that wanted to combine technology and magic in order to bring order to chaos.  And so, they built the precognition machine.  The machine was designed to know when order needed a helping hand, and create the exact right person to set things straight.  The machine could see the future, you see, and used advanced cloning techniques to create powerful agents of order whose fate, and thus victory, was preordained.  But like I said.  That was a long time ago.  The group has long since been forgotten, and the precognition machine has stood idle for generations.  I say that, but it did spit out that Jett fella not so long ago.  He's hardly a super-soldier built for heroics, though, is he?

GEAR

- Black iron ring on a chain around his neck
- Full-face rebreather mask
- Memoryform multipurpose sidearm (Securely stored on the ship)
- Two deactivated utility bots (erratic behavior, need repairs) (On the ship)

NOTES

OOC Although Jett has the Looper ability, he doesn't actually possess the ability to time travel - mechanically he uses the looper ability but in the fiction he acts instinctively on impulse sometimes and it often ends up saving him from harm; he believes it is fate guiding his hand but it's still unclear if he actually is destined to do anything or just the result of a malfunctioning machine.
