# 3. Tips and Best Practices

1. Use Folders
	1. Normally when playing with Iron Vault the default folder structure is perfect. But since this vault has several players' content, its probably a good idea to use folders. We have a campaigns folder, and within that, you'll see subfolders for characters played. 

2. Common plugins used (you might want to download these)
	1. `Self-Hosted Livesync` - For syncing the vault with other players, *you probably already have this installed.*
	2. `Iron Vault` - for playing Ironsworn, Starforged, or Sundered Isles... you need this one to actually play here.
	3. `Dataview` - for fancy character sheets and other queries.
	4. `Excalidraw` - for drawing, maps, and other fancy things.
	5.  Virtual Linker/Dictionary - for linking back to a specific spot in a different note or to a different note all together.
