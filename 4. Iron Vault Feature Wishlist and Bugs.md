# Iron Vault Feature Wishlist
1. For all clocks and tracks created, could a property be added that reflects who the active character was when the clock or track was created? 
	1. In a multi-player scenario it is hard to figure out which tracks and clocks belong to which character. I also have dataview queries built into character sheets, and being able to automate those queries so that they only show the tracks for the proper character is really useful. But for this to work I have to manually add the active character to the properties of clocks and tracks. 
2. Is there a way to write this dataview query using a variable like "Active Character"? Right now I have to write it in manually, such as `WHERE character = "Barille Black"`. 
```
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link as "Vows", floor(progress/4) as "Progress", rank as "Rank"
FROM #incomplete 
WHERE track-type = "Vow"
WHERE character = "Barille Black"
SORT file.mtime DESC
```
3. This is a roll of the dice `dice: 2d6`, embedded via inline code `dice roller invoke`. 
How neat would it be if we could have Iron Vault have in-line embedded mechanic blocks? Something like: 
	Ikram attempts to climb down. `Face Danger Shadow; 4 v 1|6; ✅❌` It is difficult and harrowing, he is completely exhausted, but Ikram is able to climb his way down.

## Bugs
1. When I decrease my health, spirit, supply, or integrity of vehicles on my character sheet, the resulting changes are not reflected in the dice roller buttons in the sidebar. Example: I set my health from 5 to 3, however the endure harm move does not reflect this change. It is showing, and performs rolls adding 5, when it should only be adding 3 to the action die roll. 
	1. Workaround: If I click on a note outside of the campaign folder, and then back in, the move updates itself and works. I think the act of clicking in and out performs some sort of reload on my character sheet, which then updates all the numbers for the move roller.
