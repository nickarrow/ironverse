# Iron Vault Feature Wishlist
1. This is a roll of the dice `dice: 2d6`, embedded via inline code `dice roller invoke`. How neat would it be if we could have Iron Vault have in-line embedded mechanic blocks? Something like: Ikram attempts to climb down. `Face Danger Shadow; 4 v 1|6; ✅❌` It is difficult and harrowing, he is completely exhausted, but Ikram is able to climb his way down.
