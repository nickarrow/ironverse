# [[Barille 01 - Beginnings]]
> This is the beginning of a great adventure...

`iv-noroll:Begin a Session|move:starforged/session/begin_a_session`

INT. LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT SHIP, RENTED CABIN

[[Barille Black]] is sleeping on a stiff bed, wearing his dark blue suit, loosened at the neck. He has dark curly hair, and the stubble of a beard. `iv-oracle:Character Goal|91|Gain Riches, Seek Power|oracle_rollable:starforged/character/goal` 

> Growing up within the domain of a founder clan, the [[Circle of the Elder Stars]], Barille's childhood was difficult. Not being of notable bloodline meant that he was relegated to the lower ranks of the Circle's caste system. However, his ability to fight, endure, and complete jobs earned him a reputation that helped elevate his status. Working jobs meant that he was able to grow his reputation, which provided access to bigger and better jobs. Barille has since left the Circle, for reasons unknown, and is currently adrift in the sector [[Devil's Chain]], moving from job to job. 

>When Barille left the Circle he made a vow, to [[Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars]]. A house that would surpass all others and become the dominant authority within the faction. 

> Barille is on a transport ship. Not having an FTL capable ship of his own, he has to buy or barter his way to systems or sectors. He is already on a job, a posted job for the [[Risen Union]] (RU). The RU has a reputation of keeping its cards close to the vest, but the jobs pay well, even if they tend to come with little information and lead to more questions than answers. 

> Barille has sworn a vow for this job, to  `iv-track-create:Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck|The Starforged (NickArrow)/Progress/Barille/Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck.md` and he means to see it through. 

Barille is suddenly thrown out of his rented bed aboard the transport ship as the ship rocks violently. Either it is under attack or something catastrophic has happened. The damage is significant.

```
BARILLE
Good gods. I’m trying to get some sleep TODAY! 
```

He stumbles to his feat, pushes buttons on the nearby panel trying to access the ship’s systems.  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|2|2|0|5|3|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information` Barille opens crew door to see klaxons flashing, people shouting down the call. He sees a crewman running by.

```
BARILLE
Hey, what's going on? 

CREWMAN
We're under attack, someone's shooting!
``` 
 
> Yeah, this is not ideal. This is a transport, not a warship. Not wanting to be boarded, or explode.... 

Barille reaches into his pocket and flips a black iron coin. He catches it, and eyes the crewman.

```
BARILLE
Get a message to your captain to burn like hell. I'll see if I can hold them off. NOW GO!
```

> Okay - not sure who these hostiles are, nor why they’d be going after us? Straight up piracy? Going to need to deal with the immediate, and very explody, problem - and then figure out who is actually attacking transport ships out here. 

Barille pulls up the UI from his hand terminal, and initiates the pre-launch sequence for his snub fighter. Green check marks. Great, let’s get there. Barille takes off to the hanger bay. Does he get there without issue? `iv-oracle:50/50|30|Yes|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty` The ship rocks a bit, sounds like the transport pilot is making moves, but no major new strikes. 

Barille jumps into the 27 (SN-27 snub fighter), the engines are already humming. He punches the launch control and blasts out into the void.

`iv-move:Enter the Fray|Snub Fighter / Integrity|5|4|0|10|3|move:starforged/combat/enter_the_fray`  `iv-track-create:Fend off attackers until the transport can escape|The Starforged (NickArrow)/Progress/Barille/Fend off attackers until the transport can escape.md` `iv-initiative:Position|in control|in control` With a roll of the controls, Barille immediately sees the hostiles. Looks like a large frigate with at least 3 fighters circling. The transport ship is putting on a significant burn, and there are no other friendlies. Not great odds, but Barille might be able to catch them by surprise. 

```
BARILLE
Let’s see how good their scans are. 
```

Barille shields the engines, blocks EM, and goes ballistic with a burst of RCS to set up an ambush for the returning fighters.  `iv-move:Gain Ground|Shadow|5|1|0|3|4|move:starforged/combat/gain_ground` They have no idea. 

> This seems like a small time raid, and under normal circumstances, it would have been successful. Not today fellas. Barille fires the 27's railguns at the lead ship, his engine, and ship coming alive simultaneously.   `iv-move:Strike|Edge|3|1|1|9|6|move:starforged/combat/strike|burn=7:2|adds=1(ambush)`  `iv-initiative:Position|in control|in a bad spot` 

The first ship erupts, and before the others can react, Barille's fires again hitting the second target. These guys definitely didn't see him, but now they do. Barille can’t quite get a shot on the third, which starts burning away.... And then the frigate starts firing. Alarms are going off, missiles inbound, and this thing seems to have lots of guns. Barille burns and rolls the ship to evade.

```
BARILLE BLACK
ahhhhHHHHHHH! 
```

`iv-move:React Under Fire|Edge|3|1|0|9|5|move:starforged/combat/react_under_fire` Barille dodges the ballistic rounds, but there's no answer for the missiles. Barille is burning hard, but one catches him and detonates. `iv-meter:Snub Fighter / Integrity|4|2` `iv-move:Withstand Damage|Snub Fighter / Integrity|4|2|0|4|2|move:starforged/suffer/withstand_damage`  `iv-meter:Momentum|2|3``iv-initiative:Position|in a bad spot|in control` The hit is brutal, engine and navigation damage, but still flying. We're still being shot at, but the burn has put some distance between Barille and the attackers. 

Really needing to stay away from that frigate. A check of on the transport ship, and yup, they are making atmo at [[Ackriss-2]]. If Barille leaves the fight now, they'll likely just pursue the transport ship to the surface. They didn't see me before, let's try that trick again. Cutting engines, and turning up EM damping. Let's disappear and see what they do.  `iv-move:Gain Ground|Shadow|4|1|0|1|2|move:starforged/combat/gain_ground`  `iv-meter:Momentum|3|5`  `iv-track-advance:Fend off attackers until the transport can escape|The Starforged (NickArrow)/Progress/Barille/Fend off attackers until the transport can escape.md|24|32|dangerous|1` It is quiet for 30 seconds and they have no idea.

```
BARILLE BLACK
Is this really going to work again? Hahaha, suckers. I guess they're not used to anyone fighting back. Let's put a round in your drive cone. 
```

`iv-progress:Fend off attackers until the transport can escape|8|2|10|The Starforged (NickArrow)/Progress/Barille/Fend off attackers until the transport can escape.md`  `iv-oracle:Take Decisive Action|99|It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective is revealed|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/combat/take_decisive_action.take_decisive_action` After another 30 seconds, the frigate starts to burn towards the planet. As they pivot, Barille lines up the shot and fires. A direct hit, and they are out of commission... except they aren't? `iv-oracle:Action + Theme|75|Create World|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme` Their ship should be out of commission, but somehow it is still accelerating? The third fighter is nowhere on scans and something is very wrong. 

The frigate's engines aren't lit, no heat signatures, yet it is still actively pursuing the transport ship, which is headed directly to [[Reck]]. The 27's engines come alive, and then sputter, Barille isn't going to be able to catch them limping along. A bit of time passes and the frigate should have started their retro burn by now, they are going way to fast for reentry. It's beyond visual range, but sensors are still showing the frigate accelerate towards the planet. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
Oh no. They... they wouldn't. WHAT?!
```

The frigate enters atmosphere. Starts breaking apart. Whatever is left of it is going to collide with Reck and destroy a significant part of the settlement. Barille is out of range to do anything but watch.

> What is going on here? That shot in their drive cone should have put any ship out of commission. And not even that, they were accelerating for a suicide strike? How does that make sense for a low-level raid? 
> 
```
BARILLE BLACK
Okay, let's get down there and see if we can help. Hopefully the settlement had some form of defense, otherwise the destruction is going to be.... Let's just get down there.
