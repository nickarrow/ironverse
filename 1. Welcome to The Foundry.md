# 1. Welcome to The Foundry

> A shared narrative universe for **Ironsworn**, **Starforged**, and **Sundered Isles** players

**The Foundry** is a collaborative storytelling repository where players using **Obsidian + Iron Vault** can:
- 📖 **Publish their entire campaign vault** - share your adventures with the community
- 🔍 **Explore other campaigns** - read and discover the stories of fellow players
- 🌍 **Build shared worlds** - contribute to campaigns and create interconnected narratives
- 🤝 **Collaborate organically** - add characters, journals, and content to any campaign

The Foundry uses automatic governance through GitHub Actions to manage permissions and ownership, making collaboration effortless and invisible.

## How The Foundry Works

Every file in The Foundry has exactly one owner. When you create a file, you own it. When someone else creates a file, they own it. Simple.

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Create new files anywhere in the repository
- ✅ Edit, rename, move, or delete your own files
- ✅ Read everyone's files
- ❌ Edit or delete files owned by others

**What happens if you try to edit someone else's file?**

The Foundry automatically detects unauthorized edits and silently restores the file to its correct state. Your next sync will pull the corrected version. No errors, no drama, just clean content.

## Community Guidelines

The Foundry has adopted the community rules from the [Ironsworn Discord](https://discord.gg/8bRuZwK). We have only a few simple rules designed to help keep this community positive and inclusive:

**1. Hateful ideologies are not tolerated.** This includes but is not limited to hate speech based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other attacks on one's personhood.

**2. Be kind.** Discuss, don't argue. Respect the input of others. Everyone's contributions, experiences, and approaches are valued (though see rule #1). Threatening behavior, abuse, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated.

**3. Keep it clean.** Avoid NSFW content. If in doubt, mark it as NSFW or provide a content warning and enclose it in spoiler tags.

**4. Support creators.** Do not upload commercial PDFs or links to pirated materials, and do not discuss pirated content.

**5. Be respectful.** This is a shared creative space - don't create excessive empty files or folders.

**6. The "Yes, and..." Philosophy**

The Foundry embraces the improv principle of **"Yes, and..."** - a collaborative mindset that builds on others' contributions rather than negating them.

While The Foundry's technical systems prevent you from editing or deleting other players' files, you can still write whatever you want in your *own* files. This is where "Yes, and..." becomes a social contract:

**What this means in practice:**
- **Don't narratively destroy what others create.** Even in your own journals, avoid writing that another player's character died, their settlement was obliterated, or their faction was wiped out. Their creations are theirs to conclude.
- **Build on, don't bulldoze.** Reference others' content as inspiration, not as targets. Add to the universe rather than subtracting from it.
- **Treat others' creations as living stories.** That character, location, or faction might still be in active play. Write as if the original creator might continue their story tomorrow.
- **When in doubt, go adjacent.** Instead of writing definitive outcomes for others' content, write about rumors, near-misses, or your character's *perception* of events.
